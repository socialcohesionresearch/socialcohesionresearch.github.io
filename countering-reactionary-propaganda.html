<h4>Concept Note<br> 
Citizen Research Centre<br> 
February 2017</h4>

<h3>Background and Strategy:</h3>
With the recent election of Donald Trump, and the variety of executive orders he has signed, America stands divided like at no other time in recent history.

With Trump’s actions variously being considered anything from the fulfilment of election promises to the precursor of a ‘soft coup’ designed to weaken US institutions, there is cause for grave concern.

The recent revelation that Big Data, combined with very accurate psychometric profiling and targeted Facebook advertising shows how social media has become a battleground. The link below refers to the use of this method – a method which allows populists to be all things to all people.  In all likelihood, it is this method that won Trump the election.

<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/big-data-cambridge-analytica-brexit-trump">http://motherboard.vice.com/read/big-data-cambridge-analytica-brexit-trump</a>

For those that hold defined political views and polices, this approach is anathema – but across the world progressive, centre-left and centre politicians with defined policy positions will forever be on the back foot. The right is now the home of populists, and it is not difficult to see some of the most powerful nations on earth sliding towards narrow, nationalist agendas, isolationism and aggression.

Our data shows that in 2015, America was by far the biggest contributor to twitter volume – with Americans sending over 63 billion (63 652 477 832 to be exact) tweets in that year. This comprised 56% of all global twitter traffic in 2015 – and is likely to have grown in 2016.

Also, 167 million Americans use Facebook daily (2017 figures). And 62% of all American adults access news on social media - so Facebook has become a major (if not the only) source of news for many Americans.

Though not by design, Facebook has become a self-selecting stream of news content.  Through the news sources we like, we are fed a diet of one particular view point, and as the poles have moved further apart, Americans are increasingly seeing single, extreme viewpoints on a host of issues.  This with no middle ground or opposing view to counter them. Society has ‘streamed’ itself through social media, and as positions harden on each side of the spectrum, the viewpoints have become increasingly extreme.  This process will only accelerate over time.

In America, the ONLY way to counter the rise of selective news/propaganda/fake news on social media is dialogue - and even confrontation - on social media. And in so far as dialogue between the two sides of the political divide is possible, the Citizen Research Centre’s social media programmes hold the key.

Our programmes bring people from either side of a political, social, ideological or behavioural divide together on social media so they can learn from each other.

Current projects include race, xenophobia and behavioural (HIV/AIDS) programmes, but this could be extended to the US in the following ways.

Broadly, we:
<ul>
 	<li>Identify 10 or more key political issues</li>
 	<li>Mine social media data for the last five years on each – either nationally or state by state</li>
 	<li>Exhaustively report on each issue with a view to identifying trends, changes in volume, growth and nature of growth in conversation on each side of each issue. Also to establish benchmarking.</li>
 	<li>Identify within each topic and state digital activists in their thousands that would work with us in changing opinion</li>
 	<li>Contact and ‘arm’ the digital activists with relevant information and resources</li>
 	<li>Watch social media in real time, and start conversations between right wing interpretations and centre-left digital activists, with a view to challenging views, effecting change on issues and countering the harmful messaging from the Trump campaign. This with a four year timeline.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Methodology:</h3>
We will use our social media analytics tool, <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/how-we-do-it/opinion.html"><strong>Opinion</strong></a> - developed through our partnership with <a href="http://www.crimsonhexagon.com/"><strong>Crimson Hexagon</strong></a>, arguably the best social media storage and analytics tool in the world. Opinion is the tool we use to deliver our own <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/africa-twitter-index.html">African Twitter Activity Index</a>, and all our social media research for our clients. We also produce smaller, periodic pieces of work for the public (<a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/public-reports.html">here</a>), and use the tool to engage in digital advocacy for social change (<a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/digital-advocacy-for-social-change.html">here</a>).

Crimson Hexagon has stored the entire world’s conversation on social media from 2008 – <strong>over 1 trillion pieces of social media data</strong>. This allows us to run retrospective longitudinal studies – invaluable in the world of social research.

Crimson Hexagon’s proprietary array of analytics tools allows us to analyse this massive data set. Using algorithms and adaptive learning it can process and analyse billions of tweets, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, forum, chat room, comments and blog posts – sorting and making sense of the conversation. We can run this analysis by country, region or globally – in multiple languages.

At the Citizen Research Centre, we have successfully applied the power of Crimson Hexagon to our social research work.
<h3>Approach and Process:</h3>
<strong>Research, Engagement, Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation:</strong>

The process we propose engaging in is multi layered, though certain elements can run simultaneously.
<h3>Research:</h3>
The Research Phase is intensive at first (5-6 months) and then episodic (annual or bi annual)
<ul>
 	<li>We identify 10 key political issues – note that these may change over time, as Trump’s agenda changes. It also could be more than 10, depending on budget. Of course if we attacked every issue, the list could be very long, but some suggestions are:</li>
 	<li>The Mexican wall</li>
 	<li>Immigration (general)</li>
 	<li>Immigration (7 country ban)</li>
 	<li>Islamophobia</li>
 	<li>Russia</li>
 	<li>‘Fake news’ (the Trump assertion that all negative reporting is ‘fake news’ – this is a classic case of preemptive attack. Almost all the genuinely fake news being generated is being generated by the right).</li>
 	<li>Torture (the water boarding debate)</li>
 	<li>Planned Parenthood Funding (and possibly abortion rights, though this is an issue that is difficult to move opinion on)</li>
 	<li>Obamacare</li>
 	<li>Welfare</li>
 	<li>Isolationism</li>
 	<li>Gun control</li>
 	<li>Climate Change</li>
 	<li>Racism</li>
 	<li>Sexism</li>
 	<li>Hompohobia</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>By addressing each of these categories individually that we can provide meaningful and useful longitudinal data; a ready source of material for effective digital advocacy and a live streaming service in which we activate our network of digital activists.</li>
 	<li>Our highly trained analysts use Crimson Hexagon to identify all public social media posts (twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Instagram,) across each of the categories selected.</li>
 	<li>Once we have isolated this data (an exhaustive process, comprising thousands of Boolean search terms for each category), we will have isolated and categorised our data. We will do this category by category (ie: we will go live with each category as we finish it):</li>
  <li>Analyse and report on all data back dated by 5 years.</li>
<ul>
 	<li>This provides benchmarking (conversation on a category as a proportion of total) on a five year basis, and allows us to both predict and assess future data.</li>
 	<li>Produce extensive reporting on the nature of conversation within each category over the last five years – how they have changed over time, what the discussions in each of the categories have been about and so on.</li>
 	<li>Reporting would be by category and also across category – allowing us to evaluate and monitor the extent of each issue over time and going forward.</li>
 	<li>This categorisation is important – both for reporting and for use in the implementation phase of the project. Different categories will be responded to differently.</li>
 	<li>The public face of the programme can be established through this work. Easily digestible data and trends can be communicated to the public – both via traditional and social media channels. We have extensive media contacts, and we are sure that you do too!</li>
 	<li>Trends can be reported on, distributed to media and so on. Episodic work of interest to the public can be distributed.</li>
 	<li><u>We are committed to reflecting citizens views back to them, and challenging them on these views</u> – and Digital Advocacy can assist in spreading positive messaging and change oriented challenges to citizens. See our <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/digital-advocacy-for-social-change.html">digital advocacy programme</a> for more detail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Engagement:</h3>
The Engagement Phase is Ongoing: starting with large scale engagement and followed by carefully curating, maintaining, upskilling and refreshing the digital activist community
<ul>
 	<li>While we construct the Boolean (an exhaustive series of if/then constructs) search terms for each category, we engage in a parallel process that is crucial to the project.</li>
 	<li>As we look at conversations, we are able to identify an exhaustive list of ALL the people that participated in those conversations – twitter handles, Facebook profiles, Instagram accounts and so on.</li>
 	<li>We are also able to rank these participants according to their level of influence in the conversation.</li>
 	<li>While we are looking for the expression of views in each category, we uncover two strands of conversation:
<ul>
 	<li>Those that are expressing right wing (reactionary) views and</li>
 	<li>Those that are expressing centre, centre-left and left (progressive) views.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>It is the latter group of people that become our digital activists.</li>
 	<li>These digital activists become a crucial resource in the following phases of the project.</li>
</ul>
We call this network of digital activists ‘<strong>The Mycorrhiza</strong>’ after the Mycorrhizal Network:
<ul>
 	<li>This is an underground <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha">hyphal</a>network created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal">mycorrhizal</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi">fungi</a> that connect individual plants together and transfer water, carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrients and minerals. These are networks in a forest that help trees and plants that are in need– by distributing nutrients to them.</li>
</ul>
In the engagement phase, we categorise (according to whatever demographic or political positioning data we can glean) The Mycorrhiza. The goal is to (as much as possible) link peers in the Implementation phase.

We then engage with them on social media, asking them to join the network, and make material available to them on hidden web pages to ‘arm’ them for the work that follows.

This with a view to engaging and activating citizens in a vast network of ‘citizen society’ – with the intention of effecting attitudinal, political, social and behavioural change around key issues being driven by the right.
<h3>Implementation:</h3>
The Implementation Phase is Ongoing
<ul>
 	<li>In the Implementation Phase, we use the search terms identified in the Research phase, and construct a ‘live environment’.</li>
 	<li>This allows us to see in real time, across each of the categories selected, when anyone in America publicly expresses a right wing view.</li>
 	<li>By this stage we will have developed exhaustive categorisation protocols, with a range of responses ascribed to each.</li>
 	<li>At its heart, though, the live environment will rely on a bank of facilitators engaging with those that express right wing views online and ‘tagging’ in appropriate digital activists. This with a view to bring the two sides of the debate together – on a public social media platform – and stimulating thousands of conversations on social media.</li>
 	<li>These facilitators will work from constructed social media identities, with reference to the Mycorrhiza made somewhere on their various profile pages. The Mycorrhiza network itself will be represented on a website – we have booked <a href="http://www.mychorrhizals.org">mychorrhizals.org</a> specifically for this project. This will serve both as a public landing page to absorb attention, as well as a private space to upskill our network of digital activists.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monitoring and Evaluation:</h3>
The Monitoring and Evaluation Phase is Ongoing
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Evaluation panels:</strong> we are able to place all individual from both groups into social media evaluation panels. These would naturally grow over time.
<ul>
 	<li>We are then able to retrospectively and in real time evaluate all their social media behaviour. This allows us to monitor their ‘progress’ in real time and assess to what extent our interventions have had an effect – at least in the social media space.</li>
 	<li>These panels offer a very real form of monitoring whether and how all our ‘subjects’ behaviour on social media changes over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Reporting</strong>: depending on our donors appetite for reporting, monthly reports with considerable detail can be compiled on the ongoing work we do in Implementation.</li>
 	<li><strong>KPI monitoring:</strong> Using a range of tools, specific metrics (as agreed in strategy) will be monitored and reported on either daily, weekly or monthly (depending on the metric). In some cases real-time KPIs will be available.</li>
 	<li><strong>An intervention performance dashboard</strong> will be made available for regular check-in with the broader team and to demonstrate forward movement.</li>
</ul>
The following are pertinent with regard to Implementation and moving from Implementation to Monitoring and Evaluation:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Write engagement strategy:</strong> for each area of interest, we would write a specific strategy which notes key elements such as: “what does desired (community) behaviour look like?”, “what messaging do we want the community to self-propagate?”, “Who are the key individuals who control the conversation?”, “How best can we use advertising spend to amplify engagements?” as well as specific community metrics to gauge raw community performance across key platforms.</li>
 	<li><strong>Strengthen in-group:</strong> Working with the community developed during the “Broad Spectrum” phase, the disparate groups are introduced to each other, are offered a strong identity and attempts to unify these groups under a single unifying “banner” are made. A well-defined in-group will self-attract members while actively seeking dialogue with their out-group. <u>See Tajel Social Identity Theory for the theoretical framework. </u></li>
 	<li><strong>Build systems for thresholds: </strong>in social psychology, a threshold is the number of an in-group members required to cause an individual to behave in alignment with the group. In social media this provides a particularly powerful lever to change behaviour as the “culture” of social media itself is still new, fragile and in rapid evolution. <u>See theory on Thresholds and work by Leor M. Hackel for theoretical framework.</u></li>
 	<li><strong>Build facilitator network:</strong> Working with our existing trained facilitators, as well as individuals selected from the online community, will be provided with our training and brought into the counter-narrative process to either engage as themselves or as the intervention itself (i.e. build and manage one of our Twitter accounts in rotation as would a social media manager in the marketing department). This hybrid model ensures we’re able to rapidly build facilitator networks which map to the specific geographies, cultures and languages present in the areas of research.</li>
 	<li><strong>Conversation Generation:</strong> Our facilitators engage in a live environment - this engagement is made as casually as possible, and from an individual (rather than an organisations) social media account. S/he can introduce a few members of our activist community into conversations playing out in real time. We are then able to monitor the conversation as it unfolds – with our activist being chosen for their views and experience.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<br><br>
<h3>Cost and Considerations:</h3>
A full programme addressing all categories obviously implies high ongoing costs.

We are open to ‘proof of concept’ work before committing full budget to this – and in all likelihood a coalition of donors would need to be found. We are confident that once the work begins, we will prove the necessity for full-scale intervention regardless of cost concerns.

As South Africans, though, we are well placed:
<ul>
 	<li>Frankly - we have a weak currency, a high unemployment rate and excellent, trained human assets. All human assets from analysts to facilitators to web designers would be more cost effective than in the US.</li>
 	<li>We are currently running programmes of this nature, albeit on a smaller scale – and have the theoretical and practical framework to engage in work of this nature.</li>
 	<li>South Africans in general - and management of the CRC in particular - also have a good sense of international and American politics, while being at enough of a distance to approach this pragmatically rather than emotionally.</li>
 	<li>We have a rich history of dialogue, conflict resolution</li>
 	<li>We are an ethnically and religiously diverse society, well used to managing a plurality of views.</li>
 	<li>We have rich history of progressive politics – and any number of citizens eager to contribute to a safer, more progressive world.</li>

<strong>About Crimson Hexagon and CRC Opinion</strong>

<a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/how-we-do-it/opinion.html"><strong>Opinion</strong></a> is our online analytics tool, developed through our partnership with <a href="http://www.crimsonhexagon.com/"><strong>Crimson Hexagon</strong></a>, arguably the best social media storage and analytics tool in the world. Opinion is the tool we use to deliver our own Twitter Activity Index and our Social Cohesion Index, and all our social media research for our clients. Crimson Hexagon has stored the entire world’s conversation on social media from 2008 – <strong>over 1 trillion pieces of social media data</strong>. This allows us to run retrospective longitudinal studies – invaluable in the world of social research.

Crimson Hexagon’s proprietary array of analytics tools allows us to analyse this massive data set. Using algorithms and adaptive learning it can process and analyse billions of tweets, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, forum, chat room, comments and blog posts – sorting and making sense of the conversation. We can run this analysis by country, region or globally – in multiple languages.

At the Citizen Research Centre, we have successfully applied the power of Crimson Hexagon to our social research work.

We are always looking at what people are saying about an issue, or how they feel about a topic. We can answer practically any question - from the general to the specific; from the conceptual to the practical.

<strong>Bear in mind that social media data is the only data we have that is unsolicited</strong>. We are not asking people to answer questions, as in all other forms of research – <strong>we are looking at what they have said and are saying</strong>. So while it has its limitations, its power lies in its sheer size, its retrospective nature and in the honesty that comes of unsolicited data.

In essence, what can be observed is limitless with topics such as the following all being accessible: sexism, homophobia, xenophobia in any country; Boko Haram in Nigeria; AQIM in Mali; ISIS globally; the refugee crisis in Europe; Ebola in West Africa; socio-economic concerns in Nigeria; the refugee crisis in Europe; diabetes; public violence and service delivery in South Africa; corruption in Nigeria; sexism globally; regional identity in Europe; the rise of the right in Europe; what is being said about Donald Trump? (and much much more!)

Once a target area of research is identified, a process of determining exactly how (and what) individuals are saying about the topic. From this, a detailed set of search phases are determined and rapidly tested and iterated upon to these ensures data reliability, completeness and limitation of erroneous data.

Once we have isolated the data, we can engage in three parallel processes:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Digital Advocacy for Social Change</strong>: here we reflect back to citizens what they themselves are saying/thinking on social media (supported by further desktop research). This is designed either to inform or to challenge and change behaviour. We use Facebook, Twitter and traditional news sources to distribute this material, and engage digital advocates in this effort.  See more <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/digital-advocacy-for-social-change.html">here</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Live streaming and response</strong>: with health or social change subjects especially we are able to isolate and live stream any comments – and then respond to them in a dialogue led intervention process. Unlike traditional interventions, a single (small) team is able to engage, in real-time, with anybody in any target region - without causing cost escalation.</li>
 	<li><strong>Social media panels</strong>: we are able to isolate protagonists from the ‘general population’ and establish bespoke social media panels. These allow us to retrospectively analyse their data and analyse it going forward.  This way we are able to evaluate the effect of intervention measures.</li>
</ol>
The amazing thing about social media data is that it is simultaneously quantitative and qualitative, and both will always be included in our reporting. The macro and the micro come standard!

It is quantitative in that, even with a very specific topic we meaningfully access and analyse anything from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions of pieces of social media data.

It is qualitative in that the more we drill down the more we are able to explore what individual citizens say about specific topics of interest. Personal stories abound - what did individual people say - about specific topics, at specific times and in specific contexts.

Our platform can answer almost any question, if framed as follows:

<strong>What do people who are active on social media in any given country/region (or globally) feel or think about any topic of interest.</strong>

Some of our clients have raised concerns about privacy. We assure you that all the information analysed on Crimson Hexagon by the Citizen Research Centre is information that has been placed in the public domain. All twitter posts are intended for public consumption, and only open posts from other social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, comments, forums and blogs) are available for analysis.

We are reliably informed by Crimson Hexagon themselves that we are the only organisation in the world currently using Crimson Hexagon in this way.
