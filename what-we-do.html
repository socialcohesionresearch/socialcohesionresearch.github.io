        The Citizen Research Centre employs a mixture of technological excellence and years of research experience to deliver some of the most innovative and informative research available.</p>
<p>Vibrand Research, with over 12 years of Market Research experience, has established a network of independent field agencies throughout Africa and the Middle East.  It is this network that allows us to provide a broad, agile, affordable solution to social researchers looking for primary data from citizens in developing countries. Over those 12 years we’ve tried and tested various research methods. We know what works, and what doesn’t, and we draw on that knowledge and experience in our work on social issues.</p>
<p>The Citizen Research Centre runs projects on a variety of issues. When we conduct research, we:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Utilise our network of research partners in Africa and the Middle East</li>
<li>Employ cutting-edge technology in our work</li>
<li>Partner with specialist consultants with relevant knowledge</li>
<li>Make use of our years of research experience</li> 
<li>Retain an openness to learning and curiosity about what we may encounter.</li>
</ul>

      <p>We aim to use research and knowledge creation for social good. We provide primary data to organisations or individuals who may need it. Our clients include NGOs, Think Tanks, Development Agencies and Foreign Aid Organisations. </p>
<p>We develop and produce primary research. We have found that our knowledge of how to ask great questions has enabled us to conduct excellent research on almost any topic. We have specialist skillsets and areas of expertise, and we also draw on our extensive network of subject matter experts.  
Thus far we have conducted research on issues related to terrorism, extremism, refugees, migration, perceptions of safety, crime, violence, health, disease and education.</p>
<p>We are committed to an ongoing process of delivering usable research in the public interest. These are available <a href="public-reports.html">here</a>.
