 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;">Deliverables (overview):</h3>
<p>This concept note aims to show how we can deliver the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Comprehensive analysis of the volume and nature of race-based hatred </strong>on South African social media over the last 5 years</li>
  <li><strong>Two comprehensive public pieces of reporting </strong>– on racial hatred and xenophobic hatred expressed on social media over the last five years.</li>
  <li><strong>Ongoing reporting on the nature of race-based hatred on social media in South Africa</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Develop and up-skilling a crowd-sourced network of Digital Activists</strong> so that conversation interventions are facilitated  in real time with those expressing race based and xenophobic hatred on social media in South Africa</li>
  <li><strong>Two comprehensive live interventions into race-based hatred and xe</strong>nophobia on social media in South Africa going forward</li>
  <li><strong>A (social media based) Public Violence Predictor</strong> – that will assist in predicting outbreaks of public violence before they start</li>
  <li><strong>An Interference Detector</strong> – that will detect and analyse organized interference in or disruption of social media conversations</li>
  <li><strong>A bank of social media panels</strong> – to evaluate and monitor the effect of our programmes</li>
  <li><strong>An array of online dialogue and mediation tools</strong> designed to facilitate dialogue and upskill digital activists.</li>
</ul>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;">Background and Strategy:</h3>
<p>Race-based hatred on social media is rife, and continues to grow. While occasional posts make their way to the media and therefore to the public consciousness, tens of thousands of other incidents of race based hatred expressed on social media go unreported.  In fact, it could be argued that the occasional intense security of single hate based posts are a ‘straw man’ – either wittingly or unwittingly deflecting attention from the true scale of the problem.</p>

<p>A rudimentary search for race base conversation on social media (excluding xenophobia) showed almost 200 000 posts on the topic last year.  In addition, a simple search for use of ‘the k-word’; on social media showed it had been used almost 15 000 times in 2016.</p>

<p>We are certain that refined searches for xenophobic and race based would uncover many thousands more, including posts that could be classified as incitement to violence.</p>

<p>The only way to deal with racism and xenophobia on social media is by engaging through social media, and it is this that this concept note seeks to address.</p>

<p>When race based hatred – and in particular xenophobia bubbles over, often leading to public violence. Similarly, when other forms of social conflict, like service delivery protests, dissatisfaction with government, local authority and the like boil over, public violence is frequently the result.  Also, when political tensions (usually on a community/municipality level) become too acute, this too can lead to public violence.</p><p>

It is evident that in many cases of public violence (especially in urban and peri urban areas), that indications of its genesis are found on social media.
</p><p>
In collaboration with a group experienced social conflict (public violence) mediators and interveners, we also look to address the pressing issue of pre-emptive, timeous intervention through real time identification of the pre cursors to pubic violence.  This  by analyzing up to five years of social media data in order to create the ability to predict violence – analyzing historical data on social media to develop mechanisms to identify in real time the possibility of public violence in the future. Our social media method of engaging in dialogue entails bringing different parties together – in the case of public violence though, the model is to act as ‘spotters’ for mediation teams that would be able to go into the areas concerned and effect change.
</p><p>
So on a broad level, this concept note addresses three allied issues:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Race based hatred expressed on social media (defined as race based hatred directed to other race groups as opposed to other nationalities. The protagonists and victims here are variously white, black, ‘coloured’, Indian or Asian – but are all almost exclusively South Africa).</li>
  <li>Xenophobia expressed on social media (defined as race based hatred expressed by South Africans towards those of other nationalities. In practice, this is almost exclusively directed at Africans from other countries)  and</li>
  <li>Public violence, and the feasibility of establishing a social media based early warning system to allow for intervention before discontent turns violent.</li>
</ul>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;">Methodology:</h3>
<p>We will use our social media analytics tool, <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/how-we-do-it/opinion.html"><strong>Opinion</strong></a> - developed through our partnership with <a href="http://www.crimsonhexagon.com/"><strong>Crimson Hexagon</strong></a>, arguably the best social media storage and analytics tool in the world. Opinion is the tool we use to deliver our own <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/africa-twitter-index.html">African Twitter Activity Index</a>, and all our social media research for our clients. We also produce smaller, periodic pieces of work for the public (<a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/public-reports.html">here</a>), and use the tool to engage in digital advocacy for social change (<a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/digital-advocacy-for-social-change.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>Crimson Hexagon has stored the entire world’s conversation on social media from 2008 – <strong>over 1 trillion pieces of social media data</strong>. This allows us to run retrospective longitudinal studies – invaluable in the world of social research.</p><p>

Crimson Hexagon’s proprietary array of analytics tools allows us to analyse this massive data set. Using algorithms and adaptive learning it can process and analyse billions of tweets, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, forum, chat room, comments and blog posts – sorting and making sense of the conversation. We can run this analysis by country, region or globally – in multiple languages.</p><p>

At the Citizen Research Centre, we have successfully applied the power of Crimson Hexagon to our social research work.</p>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;">Approach and Process:</h3>
<h4><em>Research, Engagement, Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation:</em></h4>
<p>The process we propose engaging in is multi-layered, though certain elements can run simultaneously.</p>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Research:</strong></h3>
<p>The research &amp; instrument building phase is intensive at first 3months and then episodic (annually or bi-annually)</p>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Race-Based Hatred Component:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Our highly trained analysts use Crimson Hexagon to identify all public social media posts (twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Instagram,) in South Africa that express racial hatred. This divided into race based hatred vs xenophobia.
<ul>
  <li>We propose also addressing sexism and homophobia in time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Once we have isolated this data (an exhaustive process taking about a month of dedicated analytic work), we will have isolated and categorised our data. We then:</li>
</ul>
Analyse and report on all data backdated by 5 years.
<ol>
  <li>This provides benchmarking (conversation on a category as a proportion of total) on a five year basis, and allows us to both predict and assess future data.</li>
  <li>Produce extensive reporting on the nature of conversation within each category over the last five years – how they have changed over time, what the discussion in each of the categories have been about and so on.</li>
  <li>Reporting would be by category and also across category – allowing us to evaluate and monitor the extent of each issue over time and going forward.</li>
  <li>This categorisation is important – both for reporting and for use in the implementation phase of the project. Different categories will be responded to differently – with the most extreme being ‘incitement to public violence’.</li>
  <li>The public face of the programme can be established through this work. Easily digestible data and trends can be communicated to the public – both via traditional and social media channels. We have extensive media contacts, and we are sure that you do too!</li>
  <li>Trends can be reported on, distributed to media and so on. Episodic work of interest to the public can be distributed.</li>
  <li><u>We are committed to reflecting citizens views back to them, and challenging them on these views</u> – and Digital Advocacy can assist in spreading positive messaging and change oriented challenges to citizens. See our <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/digital-advocacy-for-social-change.html">digital advocacy programme</a> for more detail.</li>
</ol>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Public Violence Predictor:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Research for this component would be centred solely around case studies of public violence in the past – on a large, medium and small scale.</li>
  <li>We would run analytics on timeframes preceding and during public violence, with a view to establishing how grievances unfold in the social media space.</li>
  <li>We would look at the build-up – the ‘grievance’ phase, the move from grievance to incitement to public violence and the public violence phase itself.</li>
  <li>These would be exhaustively categorised, with a view to establishing the necessary search phrases to establish a live public violence predictor.</li>
  <li>Once this predictor is established, we would run the analytics back over the 5 year time frame, with a view to reporting on how social media and public violence intersect. This either on an annual or an incident by incident basis (depending on the data we uncover).</li>
  <li>Given that we wish to establish a predictive model here, we would not recommend releasing this to the public at this date (though our donor may disagree).</li>
</ul>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Engagement:</strong></h3>
<p>The Engagement Phase is Ongoing: starting with large scale engagement and followed by carefully curating, maintaining, upskilling and refreshing the digital activist community</p>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Race-Based Hatred Monitor:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>While we construct the Boolean (an exhaustive series of if/then constructs) search terms for the monitor and report on race based hatred over the last 5 years, we are engaging in a parallel process that is crucial to the project.</li>
  <li>As we look at conversations, we are able to identify an exhaustive list of ALL the people that participated in those conversations – twitter handles, Facebook profiles, Instagram accounts and so on.</li>
  <li>We are also able to rank these participants according to their level of influence in the conversation.</li>
  <li>While we are look for the expression of race based hatred on social media, we uncover two strands of conversation:
<ul>
  <li>Those that are expressing race based hatred and</li>
  <li>Those that are opposed to it, and express those opinion on social media.</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>It is the latter group of people that become our digital activists.</li>
  <li>The data that we get from our digital activists is excluded from the reporting on race based hatred, but they become a crucial resource in the following phases of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>We call this network of digital activists ‘<strong>The Mycorrhiza</strong>’ after the Mycorrhizal Network:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is an underground <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha">hyphal</a>network created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal">mycorrhizal</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi">fungi</a> that connect individual plants together and transfer water, carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrients and minerals. These are networks in a forest that help trees and plants that are in need– by distributing nutrients to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the engagement phase, we categorise The Mycorrhiza, using whatever demographic data we can glean. The goal is to (as much as possible) link peers in the Implementation phase.
</p><p>
We then engage with them on social media, asking them to join the network, and making material available to them on hidden web pages to ‘arm’ them for the work that follows.
</p><p>
This with a view to engaging and activating citizens in a vast network of ‘citizen society’ – with the intention of effecting social and behavioural change around race and xenophobia on social media.
</p>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Social Media Public Violence Predictor</strong><strong>:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Similarly, In the Implementation Phase of the Public Violence Monitoring component, we use the indicators identified in the Research Phase to construct a ‘live environment’.</li>
  <li>We are then able to monitor, in real time, all public social media in South Africa that may be a pre cursor to public violence.</li>
  <li>Our research will dictate the categorisation here, and our action will depend on the category concerned the (type of problem) as well as the volume of posts (scale of problem).</li>
  <li>As it is crucial to identify geography on this component of the project, we will use geo location (this is only available on a small percentage of posts) and manual investigation to identify the origin of posts where pertinent. This entails viewing an individual’s public social media account to establish origin.</li>
  <li>Responses could range from sharing with authorities to resolving disputes to linking those expressing views linked to public violence to our Mycorrhiza (digital activists) network to engaging ‘hot body’ mediation teams and sending them to the point of dispute. All action standards would be discussed and agreed upon with our donor.</li>
  <li>All action will be accompanied by reporting – in which we attempt to uncover the nature of the grievance, its geography and its potential outcome.  As time goes by, these reports evolve from ‘reporting on live events’ to reporting on past events’.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For both programmes, we are also able to establish online dialogue platforms</strong>, and invite people we have identified to participate in them. These provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dedicated online spaces for dialogue and intervention.</li>
  <li>Spaces for mediators to facilitate discussion between relevant peers around topics of interest/concern.</li>
  <li>These are full customisable, and offer very powerful tools for sharing experiences, uploading material, generating discussion and effecting change.A similar process can be engaged in with the public violence monitoring – if the intention is to go beyond monitoring and ‘hot body’ response to attempting to defuse tension on social media as well.</li>
  <li>We will, through the course of our work on flare ups of public violence, be able to establish banks of those involved in the grievance and incitement phases – on both side of the conversation.</li>
  <li>This means we would be able to establish a bank of Mycorrhiza that could be used as a calming force in a live monitoring and response environment.</li>
</ul>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong> Interference Detector:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>In both programmes, we will be alert to any organised disruption or manipulation of the conversation.</li>
  <li>Any unusual activity will be identified and investigated and if appropriate communicated to the media.</li>
</ul>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Implementation:</strong></h3>
<p>The Implementation Phase is Ongoing</p>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Race-Based Hatred Monitor:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>In the Implementation Phase, we use the search terms identified in the Research phase, and construct a ‘live environment’.</li>
  <li>This allows us to see in real time when anyone in South Africa on social media publicly expresses a form of race based hatred – either racism or xenophobia.</li>
  <li>By this stage we will have developed exhaustive categorisation protocols, with a range of responses ascribed to each.</li>
  <li>At its heart, though, the olive environment will rely on a bank of facilitators engaging with those that express race based hatred online and ‘tagging’ in appropriate.</li>
  <li>The crowd sourced facilitators  will work from ‘personal’ social media accounts (rather than organisational ones)with oblique reference to the Mycorrhiza made on their various social media profile pages.  The Mycorrhiza network itself will be represented on a website – we have booked <a href="http://www.mychorrhiza.org">mychorrhiza.org</a>.  This will serve both as a public landing page to absorb attention, as well as a private space to inform and upskill our network of digital activists.</li>
</ul>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Public Violence Predictor:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Similarly, In the Implementation Phase of the Public Violence Monitoring component, we use the indicators identified in the Research Phase to construct a ‘live environment’.</li>
  <li>We are then able to monitor, in real time, all public social media in South Africa that may be a pre cursor to public violence.</li>
  <li>Our research will dictate the categorisation here, and our action will depend on the category concerned ( the type of problem) as well as the volume of posts (scale of problem).</li>
  <li>As it is crucial to identify geographic location on this component of the project, we will use geo location (this is only available on a small percentage of posts) and manual investigation to identify the origin of posts. This entails observing individual social media accounts with a view to establishing origin.</li>
  <li>Responses could range from sharing with authorities to resolve disputes to linking those expressing views linked to public violence to our Mycorrhiza network to engaging ‘hot body’ mediation teams and directing them to the point of dispute.</li>
  <li>These actions will be accompanied by reporting – in which we attempt to uncover the nature of the grievance, its geography and its potential outcome. As time goes by, these reports evolve from ‘reporting on live events’ to reporting on past events’.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>For all programmes, we are also able to establish online dialogue platforms</strong>, and invite people we have identified to participate in them. These provide:
<ul>
  <li>Dedicated online spaces for dialogue and intervention.</li>
  <li>Spaces for mediators to facilitate discussion between relevant peers around topics of interest/concern.</li>
  <li>These are full customisable, and offer powerful tools for sharing experiences, uploading material, generating discussion and effecting change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Monitoring and Evaluation:</strong></h3>
<p>The Monitoring and Evaluation Phase is Ongoing</p>

<p><strong>Across both programmes</strong>, the following are pertinent with regard to Implementation and moving from Implementation to Monitoring and Evaluation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Write engagement strategy:</strong> for each area of interest, we would write a specific strategy which notes key elements such as: “what does desired (community) behaviour look like?”, “what messaging do we want the community to self-propagate?”, “Who are the key individuals who control the conversation?”, “How best can we use advertising spend to amplify engagements?” as well as specific community metrics to gauge raw community performance across key platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Strengthen in-group:</strong> Working with the community developed during the “Broad Spectrum” phase, the disparate groups are introduced to each other, are offered a strong identity and attempts to unify these groups under a single unifying “banner” are made. A well-defined in-group will self-attract members while actively seeking dialogue with their out-group. <u>See Tajel Social Identity Theory for the theoretical framework. </u></li>
  <li><strong>Build systems for thresholds: </strong>in social psychology, a threshold is the number of an in-group members required to cause an individual to behave in alignment with the group. In social media this provides a particularly powerful lever to change behaviour as the “culture” of social media itself is still new, fragile and in rapid evolution. <u>See theory on Thresholds and work by Leor M. Hackel for theoretical framework.</u></li>
  <li><strong>Build facilitator network:</strong> Working with our existing trained facilitators, local communities (such as RLABS) as well as individuals selected from the online community, will be provided with our training and brought into the counter-narrative process to either engage as themselves or as the intervention itself (i.e. build and manage one of our Twitter accounts in rotation as would a social media manager in the marketing department). This hybrid model ensures we’re able to rapidly build facilitator networks which map to the specific geographies, cultures and languages present in the areas of research.</li>
  <li><strong>Conversation Generation:</strong> Our facilitators engage in a live environment - this engagement is made as casually as possible, and from an individual (rather than an organisations) social media account. S/he can introduce a few members of our activist community into conversations playing out in real time. We are then able to monitor the conversation as it unfolds – with our activist being chosen for their views and experience.</li>
</ul>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Race-Based Hate monitor:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Evaluation panels:</strong> we are able to place all individual from both groups (those perpetrating race based hatred and those responding to it) into social media evaluation panels. These would natural grow over time.
<ul>
  <li>We are then able to retrospectively and in real time evaluate all their social media behaviour. This allows us to monitor their ‘progress’ in real time and assess to what extent our interventions have had an effect – at least in the social media space.</li>
  <li>These panels offer a very real form of monitoring whether and how all our ‘subjects’ behaviour on social media changes over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li><strong>Reporting</strong>: Monthly reports with considerable detail can be compiled on the ongoing work we do in Implementation.</li>
  <li><strong>KPI monitoring:</strong> Using a range of tools, specific metrics (as agreed in strategy) will be monitored and reported on either daily, weekly or monthly (depending on the metric). In some cases real-time KPIs will be available.</li>
  <li><strong>An intervention performance dashboard</strong> will be made available for regular check-in with the broader team and to demonstrate forward movement.</li>
</ul>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Public Violence Predictor:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>While all the monitoring and evaluation detailed above can be made available for the Public Violence Component of the work, it is likely that evaluation will be a measure of whether it achieves the following:
<ul>
  <li>Accurate prediction of flare-ups of public violence (within reason, and those that find an outlet on social media)</li>
  <li>Allows for interventions that stop the flare up of public violence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Deliverables and Timelines: </strong></h3>
<p>While this project is designed to be an ongoing one, we will work to an initial 6 month timeline.  The first 3 months are dedicated to Research, and the second 3 months are dedicated to Engagement, Implementation, Testing and Monitoring and Evaluation.</p>

 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Race Based Hatred in SA: broad overview of available data (unrefined search terms; dipstick)</strong></h3>
<p>The Citizen Research Centre’s Twitter Index for Africa 2015 shows SA to be the most active Twitter users by population on the continent. Over 250 000 000 tweets were sent in 2015, and 90% of them were in English.</p><p>

A VERY quick dip showed us the scale of the problem.  Note that the search terms we used are unrefined and would include a lot of conversation round race rather than race hatred.  Conversely, we have only used a few search terms here, and could draw in a lot more data once more are added.  Also this tends to focus on ‘White race hatred’; Black race hatred terms are more nuanced and is consequently under-represented here. We have also deliberately excluded xenophobia here; we believe that should sit in a separate programme (as should sexism and homophobia).</p><p>

Once the programme is established, our Boolean search terms would number in the thousands and be designed to exclude conversation around race hatred, and only racially hateful speech itself. This is especially important for reporting – whereas for live responsive dialogue our mediator would be able to determine the exact nature of each post.</p><p>

Race based hate speech on SA social media year on year (all social media platforms):</p><p>

An overview of 2016 thus far:</p>

<strong>The ‘K-Word’</strong>

<p>Looking only at the worst word of all - the ‘K word’ has been used on social media in SA 59 754 times since 2010. This has gotten steadily worse – with 15 414 of these mentions in this year alone. Bear in mind some are self-referential, which would be addressed in paid analysis work.</p>

<strong>Some examples</strong>

<p>Here are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of posts. These include twitter handles, and each could be engaged in live dialogue, and/or added to a ‘panel’ of perpetrators so we could retrospectively examine their behaviour, as well as monitor it going forward.</p>

<p><a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/how-we-do-it/opinion.html" target="_blank"><strong>Opinion</strong></a> is our online analytics tool, developed through our partnership with <a href="http://www.crimsonhexagon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Crimson Hexagon</strong></a>, arguably the best social media storage and analytics tool in the world. Opinion is the tool we use to deliver our own Twitter Activity Index and our Social Cohesion Index, and all our social media research for our clients. Crimson Hexagon has stored the entire world’s conversation on social media from 2008 – <strong>over 1 trillion pieces of social media data</strong>. This allows us to run retrospective longitudinal studies – invaluable in the world of social research.
</p><p>
Crimson Hexagon’s proprietary array of analytics tools allows us to analyse this massive data set. Using algorithms and adaptive learning it can process and analyse billions of tweets, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, forum, chat room, comments and blog posts – sorting and making sense of the conversation. We can run this analysis by country, region or globally – in multiple languages.
</p><p>
At the Citizen Research Centre, we have successfully applied the power of Crimson Hexagon to our social research work.
</p><p>
We are always looking at what people are saying about an issue, or how they feel about a topic. We can answer practically any question - from the general to the specific; from the conceptual to the practical.
</p><p>
<strong>Bear in mind that social media data is the only data we have that is unsolicited</strong>. We are not asking people to answer questions, as in all other forms of research – <strong>we are looking at what they have said and are saying</strong>. So while it has its limitations, its power lies in its sheer size, its retrospective nature and in the honesty that comes from unsolicited data.
</p><p>
In essence, what can be observed is limitless with topics such as the following all being accessible: sexism, homophobia, xenophobia in any country; Boko Haram in Nigeria; AQIM in Mali; ISIS globally; the refugee crisis in Europe; Ebola in West Africa; socio-economic concerns in Nigeria; the refugee crisis in Europe; diabetes; public violence and service delivery in South Africa; corruption in Nigeria; sexism globally; regional identity in Europe; the rise of the right in Europe; what is being said about Donald Trump? (and much much more!)
</p><p>
Once a target area of research is identified, a process of determining exactly how (and what) individuals are saying about the topic. From this, a detailed set of search phases are determined and rapidly tested and iterated upon to these ensures data reliability, completeness and limitation of erroneous data.
</p><p>
Once we have isolated the data, we can engage in three parallel processes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Digital Advocacy for Social Change</strong>: here we reflect back to citizens what they themselves are saying/thinking on social media (supported by further desktop research). This is designed either to inform or to challenge and change behaviour. We use Facebook, Twitter and traditional news sources to distribute this material, and engage digital advocates in this effort.  See more <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/digital-advocacy-for-social-change.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Live streaming and response</strong>: with health or social change subjects especially we are able to isolate and live stream any comments – and then respond to them in a dialogue led intervention process. Unlike traditional interventions, a single (small) team is able to engage, in real-time, with anybody in any target region - without causing cost escalation.</li>
  <li><strong>Social media panels</strong>: we are able to isolate protagonists from the ‘general population’ and establish bespoke social media panels. These allow us to retrospectively analyse their data and analyse it going forward.  This way we are able to evaluate the effect of intervention measures.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The amazing thing about social media data is that it is simultaneously quantitative and qualitative, and both will always be included in our reporting. The macro and the micro come standard!
</p><p>
It is quantitative in that, even with a very specific topic we meaningfully access and analyse anything from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions of pieces of social media data.
</p><p>
It is qualitative in that the more we drill down the more we are able to explore what individual citizens say about specific topics of interest. Personal stories abound - what did individual people say - about specific topics, at specific times and in specific contexts.
</p><p>
Our platform can answer almost any question if framed as follows:
</p><p>
<strong>What do people who are active on social media in any given country/region (or globally) feel or think about any topic of interest?</strong>
</p><p>
Some of our clients have raised concerns about privacy. We assure you that all the information analysed on Crimson Hexagon by the Citizen Research Centre is information that has been placed in the public domain. All twitter posts are intended for public consumption, and only open posts from other social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, comments, forums and blogs) are available for analysis.
</p><p>
We are reliably informed by Crimson Hexagon themselves that we are the only organisation in the world currently using Crimson Hexagon in this way.
