<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>Opinion accesses a database of almost 1 trillion posts and counting, dating back to 2010. Information is captured from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, blog posts and forums. Every single public social media conversation globally has been captured and is available to us, and is reliable for analysis as far back as 2010.</p><p>
We approach each project on a case-by-case basis and design an analytical strategy based on the objectives and the data we uncover. Research on Opinion is a fact finding mission – we can hold no pre-conceived notions about what is there, but what we can do is assure you that we have the best tools and the best possible analysts available to mine and make sense of relevant social media data.</p><p>
To illustrate the tailorability and detail possible with Opinion, we offer a sample of case studies below, drawn from our publicly available reports:</p>
<h3><strong>Case Study One:</strong> Age identification: drawn from Brexit Re-Engage </h3>
<p>We can accurately predict the age of a significant percentage of people engaging in a conversation. This enabled us to show that 18-35 year olds in the UK were remarkably disengaged from the Brexit conversation on social media, before and after the referendum.</p><p>
From the 297 million posts generated during June of 2016 in the UK, we identified 7 496 582 related to Brexit. The <a href="http://www.crimsonhexagon.com/" target="_blank">Crimson Hexagon</a> platform then used a complex algorithm to identify the age groups associated with those posts. We were able to identify the age of over 22% of those posts. This leaves us with 1 707 771 posts to analyse – a very healthy sample of public opinion on Brexit. The study focussed on the level of engagement of various age groups in the conversation, rather than the sentiment or opinion.

<p>What we see above is a spectacular lack of engagement in the topic from the very people we would expect to be engaged in it – young, social media savvy voters, purportedly with a strong interest in staying in the EU.
Looking at the age band 18-35 collectively – at their height (23-26 June) they contributed only 6.3% of the total conversation on Brexit. And within days of the referendum (27-30 June) this had dropped to a lamentable 3.5% of the conversation.</p><p>
Between the 1 and the 22nd June - relative to their total online engagement - Britain’s youngest eligible voters (18-24 year olds) devoted only 0.27% of their online conversation to Brexit. This figure climbed to an unimposing high of 3.8% of their total conversation on the weekend after the referendum, and then plummeted to only 0.69% for the remainder of June 2016.</p><p>
By contrast, the 35 plus group devoted 2.61% of their total online conversation to Brexit during the period 1-22 June (9 times as much as the youth), rose to 7.99% on the day of the referendum (twice as much as the youth) and then continued at 9.94% (14 times as much as the youth) for the remainder of June.</p><p>
Citizens under the legal voting age were considerably more engaged than those aged 18-24 and 25-35, but far less engaged than those aged over 35.

<h3>Case Study 2: Lying, Pre and Post Brexit</h3>
<p>Here we took a look at the lies that were told around the Brexit referendum. We isolated all conversation related to lying on social media in the UK from January to June 2016.</p><p>
Here is a timeline of the conversation:
</p>
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/blog-images/lies_month.jpg" alt="Brexit Lies Overview">
<p>If we look at the data related to lying and political parties across the research period, we find the following:</p><p>
The conservatives suffered textbook fall out of a party which is not only divided but where opposing camps campaign fiercely for their respective positions. They garnered 19% of the total conversation over the period.  
UKIP were arguably the expected front runner in the devisiveness stakes, but they were unified in their goal and their message – 8% of conversation referencing lies and political parties were UKIP related.</p><p>
And Labour seems fairly well trusted across the board with only 3% of conversation linked to their fabrications.
In the below graph the Conservatives are represented by the yellow line; Labour the purple and UKIP the turquoise.
</p>
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/blog-images/parties.jpg" alt="Brexit Political Party Lies">
<p>We did a similar categorisation with individual politicians:</p>
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/blog-images/politicians.jpg" alt="Brexit Politician Lies">
<p>Here we looked at what percentage of the conversation on lying referenced various politicians, before and after the referendum:</p><p>
Of course the lying peaked right around the Brexit campaign! So who was most reviled on social media before and after the vote?</p><p>
Interestingly, David Cameron dropped from 21% of the conversation to just 4% after the vote, perhaps due to his honourable resignation.</p><p>
Boris Johnson took a while to step down from his ambitions, and shot up from 8% to 24% after the Brexit vote! This massive rise in bad sentiment was fueled by purported lies he told, and also by his decision to step down from his campaign to lead the Tories.</p><p>
Nigel Farage remained pretty steady at 22% before and after – presumably social media didn’t have very high expectations of him.</p><p>
Michael Gove tripled his score from 3% to 9% in the wake of the Brexit vote.</p><p>
The Conservatives rise from 6 to 10 percent, as the fallout hits the party.  And Labour also rises from less than 1% to 4% as they are also plunged into crisis.</p><p>
Crucially we are able to categorise and then look at the conversation before and after a certain date.  Bear in mind that we are able to do this to any data going back to 2010.</p><p>
We can also provide topic wheels on the conversation, and deep dive them for bespoke studies:

<h3>Case Study 3: Affinities, drawn from Pound for Pound: Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p>In this piece we isolated the discussion around crypto currencies vs the pound in relation to Brexit.</p><p>
Affinities analysis allows us to match the interests of the people contributing to the Pound conversation against the rest of twitter, do the same for the members of the Crypto Currency conversation and then compare the variances of each.</p><p>
What we found was that those contributing to the Pound conversation tended to be more ‘establishment’ oriented – with much higher than average interest in stock markets, forex, David Cameron and finance.</p><p>
Those contributing to the Crypto Currency conversation were demonstrably more forward thinking – and tended to be relatively more interested in Noam Chomsky, peer-to-peer sharing services(P2P), Bitcoin and Reddit that the global Twitter average.</p>
<h3>Case Study 4: Boko Haram and the rise of fear</h3>
<p>In this study we looked at various socio economic concerns in Nigeria with the aim of determining the impact the rise of Boko Haram had on how citizens perceived their personal threat levels.</p><p>
We analysed over 1 BILLION posts over a 5 year study period, starting in January 1st 2010. Below is an overview categorisation of that data set:
