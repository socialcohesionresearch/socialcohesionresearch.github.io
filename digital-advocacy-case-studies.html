<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>Opinion accesses a database of almost 1 trillion posts and counting, dating back to 2010. Information is captured from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, blog posts and forums. Every single public social media conversation globally has been captured and is available to us, and is reliable for analysis as far back as 2010.</p><p>
We approach each project on a case-by-case basis and design an analytical strategy based on the objectives and the data we uncover. Research on Opinion is a fact finding mission – we can hold no pre-conceived notions about what is there, but what we can do is assure you that we have the best tools and the best possible analysts available to mine and make sense of relevant social media data.</p><p>
To illustrate the tailorability and detail possible with Opinion, we offer a sample of case studies below, drawn from our publicly available reports:</p>
<h3><strong>Case Study One:</strong> Age identification: drawn from Brexit Re-Engage </h3>
<p>We can accurately predict the age of a significant percentage of people engaging in a conversation. This enabled us to show that 18-35 year olds in the UK were remarkably disengaged from the Brexit conversation on social media, before and after the referendum.</p><p>
From the 297 million posts generated during June of 2016 in the UK, we identified 7 496 582 related to Brexit. The <a href="http://www.crimsonhexagon.com/" target="_blank">Crimson Hexagon</a> platform then used a complex algorithm to identify the age groups associated with those posts. We were able to identify the age of over 22% of those posts. This leaves us with 1 707 771 posts to analyse – a very healthy sample of public opinion on Brexit. The study focussed on the level of engagement of various age groups in the conversation, rather than the sentiment or opinion.
