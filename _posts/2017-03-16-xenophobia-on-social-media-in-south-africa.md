   <p> In the build up to the ‘Anti-Immigrant’ march in Pretoria towards the end of February, we decided to take a look at xenophobia on social media in South Africa.
</p><p>
This is a work in progress – we intend releasing our Xenophobia on Social Media Monitor shortly – this will provide year by year view of xenophobia on social media in SA – from 2011-2016.
</p><p>
Our method is discussed at the end of this document, and a full PDF version of this report is available here:

We provided the following:
</p><p>
<ul>
    <li>An overview of conversation around xenophobia on social media in South Africa from 2011 to 2017: volume and nature of conversation</li>
    <li>Analysed this conversation and divided it into a number of categories – principally Provocation, Pacification, Nuanced Opinion and Other (news, reporting and international xenophobia). We then excluded ‘Other’ from al, our analysis.</li>
    <li>Anatomy of an Incident: a detailed look at xenophobic conversation in South Africa in January and especially February 2017 – culminating in the Pretoria march.</li>
    <li>A view of how data can be presented on a yearly, monthly and daily basis.</li>
    <li>‘Data Snapshots’ of both sides of the conversation on South African social media during this period</li>
    <li>The various factors that contribute to the conversation, politicians that have had an impact and a ‘provocateur’ list of the most prolific xenophobic authors for the latter part of February 2017.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Main findings were as follows:</h3>
<p>
The vast majority of the conversation on xenophobia in South Africa comprises of shared news stories and international xenophobia – ranging from refugee crises to Brexit to Trump.
</p><p>
When we excluded all that data, we are still left with a sizable conversation – driven by individuals rather than media outlets and focusing on xenophobia in South Africa.
</p><p>
Volumes range from 195 000 social media posts on the topic in 2014 to 542 000 in 2015.  2015 represented the highest volume by far – due to the comments made by Goodwill Zweletini, subsequent violence in KZN and then the rest of the country. The average over the year was 1483 per day, but during the period in question averaged 5670.
</p><p>
The whole of 2016 saw 234 000 posts on xenophobia at an average of 640 per day.  In the first 2 months of 2017, we have already seen over 115 000 posts, at an average of 1958 per day.
</p><p>
We run an Organized Interference Monitor – this looks for interference from individuals or organizations and showed that on average there were no more than 3 contributions to the conversation made by any individual.  We’re able to conclude from this that there was not organized interference in the conversation – we stress that on a retrospective basis this tool looks at averages per author, so isn’t a perfect instrument. In a live environment, it’s easier to look for spikes from individuals.
</p><p>
It is in looking at the nature of the conversation that certain trends emerge. We looked at 9 themes within the conversation, and how they change over time.
</p><p>
We start with the <strong>pacifying</strong> voices in the conversation, comprising Anti-Xenophobia,</p><p>

This is defined as directly speaking out against xenophobia.
</p><p>
Anti-xenophobia ranged from a low of 10% in 2016 to a high of 34% in 2015.  In January and February, this year people speaking out against xenophobia comprised 29% of the conversation.
</p><p>
The pattern we see here is that as a component of the total conversation anti-xenophobia remains low until a crisis emerges or an incident occurs, at which point it climbs substantially.  So in 2015, it rose to 34% of the conversation and this year rose to 29% of the conversation. Typically, politicians get involved once a crisis has evolved, and their voices are amplified in the anti-xenophobic conversation. Notable here was Julius Malema’s tweet (below), along with Fikile Mbalula, Thabo Mbeki and Mmusi Maimane. Politicians voices are undoubtedly of great importance in the conversation, and should be heard as early, as clearly, as unanimously and as unambiguously as possible.

<h3>Pacifying: Anti -Violence</h3>

This is defined as directly speaking out against violence within the context of xenophobia.

Speaking out against violence forms a fairly low component of the conversation. In years in which there are no demonstrable xenophobic crises – at least that become widely known – it emerges as less than 1% of the conversation - in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016. In years in which high-profile incidents occur, it rises to 6% - this in 2015 and Jan and Feb 2017.

<p>
These are defined as anti-xenophobia posts stressing that foreign/immigrant ‘transgressors’ are a small minority of immigrants/foreigners.
</p><p>
&nbsp;

A hardening of attitudes over time is evident here. This category comprised 11% of all conversation at its height in 2011 and has steadily dropped to 3% of all conversation on the topic in 2017. This narrative does decline in years of crisis, though – 2015 and 2017 – which suggests that it may be being replaced my more overt anti-xenophobic contributions.
</p><p>
<strong>Sample Tweets:</strong>
<h3>Provoking: Pro Xenophobia/Violence</h3>
Defined as outright xenophobia or condoning/support of violence as the answer
</p><p>
This is the most disturbing of all our categories, as these are social media posts that are a direct incitement to violence. It generally comprises only 1% of the conversation but rose to 4% in 2015 and 2016. In 2017 the pro-xenophobic conversation was focused on crime rather than violence against foreigners because they are foreign, explaining why the proportion of this conversation remained low at 1%.
</p><p>
It is worth considering though that these still comprise large numbers of posts, and in evaluating the scale of the issue, looking at raw numbers is informative. In 2015 this category comprised 21 660 posts, in 2016 9 363 posts and in just 2 months in 2017 incitement to xenophobic violence comprised 1 156 posts.

Hateful Anti-Immigrant rhetoric built in 2013 (at 16% of conversation), reached a peak in 2014 at 22% of the conversation. This tends to decline as a proportion of total conversation when crises occur – suggesting that it is of more concern in building up to events than during the events themselves. This emphasis the point that anti-immigrant rhetoric needs to be monitored and addressed on an ongoing basis – it is part of the buildup phase and can be a precursor to violent incidents.

This theme has grown over time, and also finds some expression in the ‘finger pointing’ category. Bear in mind that this category unashamedly uses crime as an excuse for aggression, violence and hatred towards all foreigners/immigrants. As such, its growth to comprising 13% of the 2016 conversation and 10-% of the 2017 conversation is troubling. This has not been helped by politicians, who have clumsily attempted to link the crime to foreigners/immigrants without clearly stating their position, and without providing any clear evidence of this. At best this position encourages closet xenophobes to make their positions more overt, and at worst incites violence.
</p><p>
Also, even if crime stats were to show a preponderance of criminality amongst foreigners, we must remember that these stats can tend to be self-selective.  The police may go after foreigners because they are foreigners - not because they are criminals - and they thus provide easy pickings.  Also, the argument that ‘many foreigners are criminal’ is a circular one if you consider undocumented or ‘illegal’ foreigners to be criminal by definition.
</p><p>
<h3>Nuanced Opinion</h3>
Nuanced Opinion is a large and fascinating category of conversation. It ranges from a form of justification – ‘I’m not xenophobic but…’ to deflection onto other groups – notably White South Africans and colonialism.

Problem finding and finger pointing have always been a dominant category – in most years the biggest of them all. It notably falls away during crisis years as more anti-xenophobic voices join the conversation. It has, though, been as high as 62% of the conversation in 2011.
</p><p>
It is currently at its lowest point in 6 years and 2 months, comprising ‘only’ 20% of the conversation in 2017.  This is largely due to the phenomenal recent growth of Anti-White/Anti-Colonial sentiment in the conversation.

This theme has reached its height in the current 2017 conversation – albeit only at 4% of the conversation. This is a conversation that accuses foreigners of being criminals while rejecting xenophobia and/or violence.

<strong>&lt;Sample Tweets:&gt;</strong>
<h3>Nuanced Opinion: Anti-White/ Anti-Colonial</h3>
Defined as xenophobic conversation focused on or directed against white South Africans or colonialism
</p><p>
The anti-white and/ or anti-colonial narrative has grown substantially in 2017.  From a low of 1% in 2011, it now comprises fully 24% of the total conversation on xenophobia.  This is a trend that we see in other hot button issues (like land and #feesmust fall).
</p><p>
The growth of this political view has meant that its politics are attached to multiple issues – it is a ‘world view’ rather than a specific political stance.
<h3>The Role of Politicians:</h3>
Politicians have played and continue to play an important role in developing narratives and influencing action on the ground when it comes to xenophobia in South Africa. Observers noted that the timing was convenient for the ANC and that it was likely serving some political interest. Others blamed the DA or the newly established South Africa First party.
</p><p>
The DA's Herman Mashaba received mixed responses to his comments on foreigners living in Johannesburg. A large majority of content highlighted Mashaba's possible role in instigating xenophobic violence.
</p><p>
&lt;Mashaba Tweets&gt;
</p><p>
While Mashaba was criticised for this comments, Julius Malema and the EFF produced a clear statement condemning the violence against foreigners. It was also interesting to note that we could not find the 'fake' anti-foreigner tweet that supposedly was produced by the EFF.
</p><p>
&lt;eff tweets&gt;
</p><p>
The failings of the current government were also seen as a major contributing factor to the xenophobic events.
