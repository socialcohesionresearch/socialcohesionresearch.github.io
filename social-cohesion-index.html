     <p>The Social Cohesion Index (SCI) is intended as the Citizen Research Centre’s main contribution to public discourse - a functional, accessible index of the level of fracture in our societies as expressed online. This is a significant and time consuming body of work which is currently unfunded. As such, it remains little more than conceptual at this stage.</p><p>

By using Opinion - our social media research tool, powered by Crimson Hexagon - the Social Cohesion Index will be built by analysing immense volumes of social media data – drawn from Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, forums and blogs. It will measure levels of cohesion / friction online in multiple countries.</p><p>

This work draws on the understanding that verbal expressions of violence often precede physical violence and that social and cultural norms can condone and encourage violence. </p><p>

What differentiates the Social Cohesion Index from survey or polling research is the method of data collection. These traditional approaches rely on participants’ honesty when answering questions, which are often of an intimate and revealing nature. This can also be negatively affected by the perceived trustworthiness of the researcher. The growth in public social media use has led to the creation of trillions of pieces of data - unfiltered, authentic views and opinions of citizens from all walks of life and every corner of the planet - insight into thoughts that previously would have only been expressed in the privacy of the home or to personal friends. As a result, we are able to monitor and measure expressions of prejudice in a way never before possible.

  <p>With the use of carefully researched and constructed search terms we can extract billions of pieces of relevant data which we then use to train intelligent algorithmic monitors. These monitors help us categorise the data content and analyse the sentiment and emotion conveyed in each Tweet, Facebook post, blog entry or forum comment we have isolated.</p><p>

The initial aim for the SCI would be to index five (5) African countries. Ideally these would countries that have high internet and social media penetration and largely use English in online conversation eg South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria and Ghana. Our methodology can be applied to other languages or population demographic and we are open to funding on this basis as well. However by concentrating on these ideal cases for the pilot study, we will require fewer man hours to achieve the required level of accuracy and insight.

    <h3>An overview of SCI project objectives:</h3>

    <div class='row'>
  <div class='medium-6 large-6 columns'>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Construct a comprehensive basket for each country, which expresses the amount of discriminatory social media activity as a percentage of total social media activity.</li>
      <li>Section each of these baskets into into relevant categories such as racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, religious intolerance and tribalism etc</li>
      <li>Represent this data in Index format across the five countries</li>
      <li>Each of these is then expressed in Index format across the five countries</li>
      <li>The relative Index is expressed as the percentage of deviation from the norm across countries included in the study - on a total as well as category level.</li>
      <li>Establish Total Indices as well as Specific Indices that evaluate all five countries against each other.</li>
    <li>Grow the index by expanding to other countries and continents until we have a global, real-time indicator of the levels of social cohesion in our societies.</li></ul></p>

    <div class='medium-6 large-6 columns'>
      <p>This report format allows for rigorous analysis over any timescale - incident specific, year-on-year, month-on-month etc. Volume charts with analysis of peaks and dips, sentiment changes and access to detailed data will facilitate on going and in-depth reporting.</p><p>

The content will then feed into our Digital Advocacy for Social Change programme where it will be distributed widely through our social media networks as a tool for social development.</p><p>
