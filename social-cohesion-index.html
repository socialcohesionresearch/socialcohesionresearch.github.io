      <p>The Social Cohesion Index (SCI) is intended as the Citizen Research Centre’s main contribution to public discourse around the level of fracture in our societies. It is currently unfunded, and requires funding as it is a significant and time consuming body of work to undertake. As such, it remains conceptual at this stage.</p><p>
The Social Cohesion Index will use Crimson Hexagon and be built using huge volumes of social media data – drawn from Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, chat rooms and blogs. It will measure levels of cohesion / friction online in multiple countries.</p>

  <p>This work draws on the understanding that verbal expressions of violence often precede physical violence. Also, social media interaction has led to citizens expressing views on public platforms that previously would have been confined to the home or circles of friends. As a result, we are able to monitor and measure expressions of prejudice in a way never before possible. We will use targeted search terms and monitors trained on thousands of relevant pieces of social media data. These then analyse billions of pieces of social media data and identify precisely the percentage of social media conversation in a country that is discriminatory/pejorative.</p>

    <h3>The Social Cohesion Index aims to:</h3>
    <p><ul><li>Index five African countries that are active in English on social media (South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria and Ghana). We suggest these because English is easier for us to analyse, and because the volumes in these countries make for greater accuracy. This could be run on developed countries (the UK and the USA) for example, and we are open to funding on this basis as well.</li><li>Establish a comprehensive basket, which expresses the amount of social media activity that is discriminatory as a percentage of total social media activity in each country</li><li>We then unpack this basket - dividing the discriminatory language into sub-sets such as racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, religious intolerance and ‘tribalism’</li><li>Each of these is then expressed in Index format across the five countries</li><li>The relative Index is expressed as the percentage from which a given country deviated from the norm across all five countries - on a total (all discriminatory language) and a specific (sexism, racism etc) level</li></ul></p>
    </div>
    <div class='medium-6 large-6 columns'>
      <p><ul><li>Once all this work is done, we can establish Total Indices as well as Specific Indices that evaluate all five countries against each other</li><li>Ongoing reporting will roll out of the Index – all countries can be rigorously analysed on a yearly and month by month basis.  Also, individual topics (sexism for example) can be analysed across countries. Yearly volume charts can be drawn that show where and why peaks and troughs in social media volume occur.</li><li>All of this work would then feed into our Digital Advocacy for Social Change programme, and would be reported on and distributed widely though our social media networks.</li><li>We will then expand this to include Europe and other continents.</li></ul></p>
