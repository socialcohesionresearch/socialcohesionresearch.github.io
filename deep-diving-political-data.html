      <p>This page aims to provide you with a small sample of the sort of research we (the Citizen Research Centre) can do into political parties. We have used the example of South African political parties to show a glimpse of the political data we can provide, but this is suited to any democracy. In fact, the volume of data available in the UK and the US would dwarf South African data and could make the predictive analytics we propose offering even more robust…</p>
      <h3>Come down our rabbit hole with us</h3>
      <p>The way that data is produced, collected and analysed has changed in the last 10 years but many political parties are only beginning to appreciate the advantage of this real-time, always-on, unsolicited(yet public), monumental source of data.</p>

<p><strong>Consider, Hillary Clinton – running for election in 2020</strong> – is heading to a swing state to give a speech. Let’s say a small town in Virginia.  She can choose from a range of topics to talk on – gun control,  supporting the family, job creation and so on. Traditionally, she would make assumptions based on the gender, ethnicity and income of the constituents - resulting in a fairly generic speech. Now, she is able to use our predictive social media analytics to determine exactly which blend of topics will boost her volume and positive coverage on social media, as well as which topics will result in a favourable differential vs her opponents.</p><p>This is done through a detailed, retrospective analysis of social media opinion on her, her party, her opponent and the opponent's party – coupled with a detailed analysis of public opinion on all major election issues.</p><p>
She is able to predict exactly how social media will respond to what she chooses to speak about – and given that social media is an approximation of what voters speak about – is able to use this tool to tailor her message on a state by state, issue by issue basis.</p><p>

The Citizen Research Centre is born of the democratisation of South Africa and we hold both public discourse and public participation dear. Our goal is to work with progressive political parties in important democracies to ensure a sound and integrated political system by providing the necessary data to reflect public discourse and encourage public participation.</p><p>
We work in partnership with <a href="https://www.crimsonhexagon.com/" target="_blank">Crimson Hexagon</a> in conducting our social media analysis. Crimson Hexagon is arguably the world’s leading social media analytics platform, and holds a repository of the entire world’s public social media conversation across all platforms.  A total of 900 billion pieces of social media data! It also provides us with the tools necessary to accurately mine and make sense of this vast data source.
</p><p>We have tailored this proof of concept to the South African political landscape, but this analysis can be conducted on political parties in any democracy.</p><p>

<strong>At a macro level, we can provide Descriptive, Decision-oriented and Predictive Analytics such as:</strong>
<ul><li>Which issues should politicians from the 3 main parties be talking about leading up to 2019 generals?</li>
<li>Do South Africans care about corruption, or are they more interested in job creation?</li>
<li>Do the ANC figures go down when the opposition mentions Nkandla, or are the more likely to go down when they talk about poverty?</li></ul></p><p>

<strong>At a micro level, we can provide analytics into:</strong>
<ul><li>The differences in micro-environments (i.e. what does a 1/10/100km square say about our party, how does this change over time?)</li>
<li>Individual party supporters/detractors behaviours</li>
<li>Community clustering and information dispersion theory</li>
</ul><p>
We have tailored this proof of concept to the South African political landscape, but this analysis can be conducted on political parties in any functioning (or non-functioning) democracy.</p><p>  

We have kept this page covert because we would prefer to provide this information directly to political parties rather before making our analysis public knowledge.</p>


<p>A project such as this, typically, comprises of five distinct phases:
</p>
<h4>Phase One:</h4><p>
Set the scene: Provides retrospective reporting on the performance of a chosen party or politician. Below you can find some snippets of the phase one analysis we have already done on the DA from 2013 to present day.</p>

<h4>Phase Two:</h4><p>
Deep dive: Provides very detailed, monthly reporting on all three parties as well as three key leaders for these parties. This is a totally customisable process – different leaders can be chosen;  also deep dives into metros can be ordered. This could be especially valuable in the build up to 2019. 
</p>
<h4>Phase Three:</h4><p>
Predictive: Here we start to move towards predictive analytics and strategy. A ‘monitor’ identifies, reflects and analyses all social media-based opinion on 12 issues of socio-political/economic concern to South Africans (such as Racism, Income inequality, Gender rights, Employment, Education…) and are correlated to party performance.</p>

<h4>Phase Four:</h4><p>
Statistical: We start the statistical work on what is expected to become over 2 trillion data points within the study. After developing a hypothesis, correlation analysis between the issues that the country is talking about against the various parties’ data on social media takes place identifying statistically significant areas of interest.</p>

<h4>Phase Five:</h4>
<p>We regress: In Phase Five we begin work on regression analysis. Regression analysis uses retrospective correlation analysis to provide predictive analytics. Predictive analytics allow us to draw ‘if-then’ hypotheses. If x politician talks about y, this is likely to have the following impact on each political parties volume and negative and positive approval ratings.  The nature of predictive analysis through regression analysis is that it becomes more and more accurate over time, as the regression hypothesis is fine-tuned as concrete ‘if-then’ data comes in.
</p>
<h3>An example of what we can do:</h3><p>
Below is a small sample of what we can achieve. We show here the depth and granularity of our analysis, and explain how it can evolve into predictive analytics. It’s also worth noting that this research is intended to be a sample rather than the complete set. Commissioned research will have higher volumes of conversation and represent a higher proportion of the total dataset – we have only worked with twitter data here, but in commissioned of work we will expand this to include all social media – Facebook, twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, blogs, comments on news sites and public chat rooms.
</p><p>
For this research we set the date parameters of 1 January 2013 to 31 August 2016.
</p><p>
We looked at all Twitter conversation originating from South Africa during this period and extracted only posts that mentioned the Democratic Alliance (DA). We were left with 931,386 posts to analyse. Greater in-depth research will be able to isolate a larger number however the sample we do have captures the majority of the conversation and is a more than sufficient size for sound analysis.
</p><p>
We then categorised the conversation into posts relating:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solely to DA</li>
  <li>To DA and ANC (African National Congress) only</li>
  <li>To DA and EFF (Economic Freedom Fighters) only</li>
  <li>DA and other or multi parties.</li>
</ul>

<p>Subdivisions were made to each. Please note that the neutral conversation is not neutral in sentiment but rather not expressly for or against a particular party.
</p><p>
The phase one reporting consists of a range of different analysis approaches. Below are four of the most commonly used.
</p>
<strong>Category Compare & Analysis</strong>
<p>Basic sentiment analysis falls short of meaningful insight when applied to the political landscape. The ‘meat’ in the social media conversation is not pro, con and neutral – it is in comparison with other parties. Categorisation of the conversation by means of algorithmic machine learning and specialised human oversight provides a complete picture of exactly what is driving sentiment.</p><p> 
It is in analysing this data on a monthly basis that the true power of our political performance analytics will be seen.

<strong>Contributor Metrics</strong>
<p>Through segmenting the conversation into basic categories we can isolate contributors who partake in particular topics or those who hold certain sentiments towards a party or politician. We can then extract certain demographic information about the individuals engaging in these separate groups.

<strong>Interests Analysis</strong>
<p>We can compare the affinities of the individuals who have contributed to a particular conversation to the affinities of a different group of people. What this means is that we can identify similarities in the interests of two chosen groups as well as find what interests differentiate them from each other.

<strong>Situational Analysis</strong><p>
Categorisation of the data allows us to finely analyse exactly what impact a specific event is having on the online conversation about and perception of a specific party or politician - be it an external world event or an internal policy decision. With enough data, predictive models can be built to project the probable impact of internal decisions. This type of analysis provides intelligent, real-time feedback and is a powerful strategic tool.</p>
