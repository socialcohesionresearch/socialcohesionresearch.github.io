      <p>The feeling of not being heard by the right people, or at all, is far too common in social advocacy. Even worse is not understanding why your message doesn’t seem to get the traction or reaction you expected.</p><p> 
Our Digital Advocacy for Social Change programme is the revolutionary approach which cost effectively addresses this issue</p><p>

Through innovative research that targets distinct advocacy issues, we create data driven reports and content which are the foundation of our advocacy strategy. By using the reach and influence of relevant key contributors, we maximise the impact of this information reaching the target audience and the wider public.</p><p>

Our focus is on progressive advocacy concerns – structural issues such as racism, sexism, prejudice and discrimination; lack of or mis-information issues such as extremism, refugees, education and health; or specific social, economic or political issues such as election campaigns, suicide, Brexit or Boko Haram.</p><p>

  <p>Our social media research tool, Opinion, is powered by <a href="http://www.crimsonhexagon.com/" target="_blank">Crimson Hexagon</a>. Our approach is to isolate an issue, produce a number of research pieces tailored to key topics – with a tonality that works towards your advocacy goals - and then use a highly customised social media networks to distribute. We can measure the reach and impact of each piece of content through Opinion and use this data to increase the efficacy of future projects.</p>
<p>We analyse vast amounts of relevant, citizen generated data to create original material that resonates with your audience. Digital Advocacy for Social Change has the best possible opportunity to change perceptions, structural beliefs and behaviours on almost any progressive cause.</p><p>

To prove this methodology we ran a pilot study on Boko Haram in Nigeria. 
A full commissioned study might look at topics such as the rise of fear, perceptions around funding, perceptions around why people join, the main drivers of radicalisation, personal stories etc. We focused on two of these: <a href="{{site.url}}/public_research/2016/06/13/Boko-Haram-Fear-and-Funding-Report.html" target="_blank">The rise of fear and Perceptions around how Boko Haram is funded</a>.

        <p><ol><li>We constructed a monitor on Crimson Hexagon looking at all social media traffic in Nigeria from 2011 to the study date in late 2015 – isolating over 1 billion social media posts.</li>
          <li>We trained this monitor to look for 2 distinct data sets  <ul><li>Issues of socio economic concern to Nigerians, with a view to seeing how Fear has grown over the last five years</li><li>Social media conversations around how Boko Haram is funded, with a view to evaluating Nigerians opinions in this regard</li></ul></li>
         <li>We used Crimson Hexagon to analyse this data – producing three main  bodies of work: <ul><li>A piece of research that showed how Fear of Personal safety had grown from less that 1% of the conversation in 2011 to 22% of the conversation in 2015 – growing to the point that it far outweighed all  other socio-economic concerns in Nigeria in 2015</li><li>A piece of research that showed that (pre-Buhari) 54% of conversation around Boko Haram funding pointed the finger firmly at government, politicians and the ‘big men’ of Nigeria</li><li>.       A set of timelines (2011-2015) showing conversation peaks and troughs around Boko haram funding conversation, with desk research evaluating why these occurred.</li></ul></li><li>We then constructed a single, abbreviated social media oriented piece of research which we published on our website. In a commissioned advocacy project, we may well have split this into three different pieces of work.
</li><li>We moved from being content creators to content distributors, and placed the research piece on Facebook – using our community of 60 000 (and growing) followers. See the post <a href="{{site.url}}/public_research/2016/06/13/Boko-Haram-Fear-and-Funding-Report.html" target="_blank">here</a></li></ul></li></ol></p>

          We spent R1000 (approximately 75 US$) on boosting the piece to relevant countries on our Facebook page (we have 60 000 African followers). The countries we boosted this to were Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, Chad (directly affected), Mali and Somalia (who also suffer from insurgency). The results were astonishing: <ul><li>It was presented to 565 829 users</li><li>The link was clicked 27 538 times</li><li>We had 8500 unique visits to our website</li><li>It was shared 614 times</li></ul></p>

      <p>These results represent an astonishing level of penetration and reach. The level of engagement is an indication of the relevancy of the information and the eagerness of the audience for this type of content. The flexible nature of this model - dependent on budget, depth of research and volume of content produced for distribution - makes it incredibly scalable. The potential impact is immeasurable.</p>
