      <p>If you work in advocacy you probably know the feeling of struggling to get your message out there.  Our digital advocacy programme can help.</p><p>
We work on individual advocacy issues, to develop and distribute content, with a view to nudging people's behaviours and structural beliefs, or informing the public on relevant issues. We can tackle any progressive advocacy concern – from the structural (racism, sexism etc) to the information led (extremism, refugees, education, health etc) to the particular (Boko Haram,  Brexit etc).</p><p>
In order to produce content, we use Opinion – our social media research analytics tool powered by Crimson Hexagon.  We isolate an issue, produce 5-6 tailored research pieces on it and then use our social media network to distribute.</p>

We are convinced that our Digital Advocacy work provides the best possible way to analyse and reflect citizen’s perceptions, nudge or inform citizens about pertinent causes and provide unparalleled distribution of pertinent, original material on almost any progressive cause.</p><p>
We have run a case study on Boko Haram at our own cost to prove our case. A full study might look at – the rise of fear, perceptions around funding, perceptions around why people join, the main drivers of radicalisation,  personal stories and so on.  We focused on two of these, the rise of fear and perceptions around how Boko Haram is funded.

        <p>The case study outline and results were as follows:</p>
        <p><ol>
          <li><img class='fadeinleft' src='{{site.url}}/images/chart.jpg'></li>
          <li>We spent R1000 (approximately 75 US$) on boosting the piece to relevant countries, and the results were astonishing: <ul><li>It was presented to 450 000 users</li><li>The link was clicked 25 000 times</li><li>We had 12 500 unique visits to our website</li><li>It was shared 550 times</li></ul></li></ol></p>

      <p>These results represent an astonishing level of penetration and reach, and constitute an almost viral response to the post.  Imagine 6 consecutive pieces of research, each with a budget of 750 dollars!
We will also shortly be launching our Twitter distribution network – here we isolate key contributors to the conversation that we have reported on (we can generate hundreds of these handles) and use them to assist in distributing material.  We then use Crimson Hexagon to track how successful the Twitter post has been.</p><p>
