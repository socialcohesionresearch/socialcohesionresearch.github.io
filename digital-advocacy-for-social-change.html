      <p>The feeling of not being heard by the right people, or at all, is all too common in social advocacy. Even worse is not understanding why your message doesn’t seem to get the traction or reaction you expected.</p><p> 
Our Digital Advocacy for Social Change program is the revolutionary approach which goes to the core of the problem.</p><p>

Through innovative research, targeting distinct advocacy issues, we create data driven reports and content which are the foundation of our advocacy strategy. By using the reach and influence of relevant key contributors, we maximise the impact of this information reaching the target audience and the wider public.</p><p>

Our focus is on progressive advocacy concerns – structural issues such as racism, sexism, prejudice and discrimination; lack of or mis-information issues such as extremism, refugees, education and health; or specific social, economic or political issues such as election campaigns, suicide, Brexit or Boko Haram.</p><p>

  <p>Our social media research tool, Opinion, is powered by Crimson Hexagon. Our approach is to isolate an issue, produce a number of research pieces tailored to key topics and then use a highly customised social media networks to distribute. We can measure the reach and impact of each piece of content through Opinion and use this data to increase the efficacy of future projects.</p>
<p>We analyse vast amounts of relevant, citizen generated data to create original material that resonates with your audience. Digital Advocacy for Social Change has the best possible opportunity to change perceptions, structural beliefs and behaviours on almost any progressive cause.</p><p>

To prove this methodology we ran a pilot study on Boko Haram in Nigeria. 
A full commissioned study might look at topics such as the rise of fear, perceptions around funding, perceptions around why people join, the main drivers of radicalisation, personal stories etc. We focused on two of these: The rise of fear and Perceptions around how Boko Haram is funded.

        <p><img class='fadeinleft' src='{{site.url}}/images/chart.jpg'></p><p>
          We spent R1000 (approximately 75 US$) on boosting the piece to relevant countries, and the results were astonishing: <ul><li>It was presented to 565 829 users</li><li>The link was clicked 27 538 times</li><li>We had 8500 unique visits to our website</li><li>It was shared 614 times</li></ul></p>

      <p>These results represent an astonishing level of penetration and reach. The level of engagement is an indication of the relevancy of the information and the eagerness of the audience for this type of content. The flexible nature of this model - dependent on budget, depth of research and volume of content produced for distribution - makes it incredibly scalable. The potential impact is immeasurable.</p>
