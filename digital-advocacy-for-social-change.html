      <p>The feeling of not being heard by the right people, or at all, is far too common in social advocacy. Even worse is not understanding why your message doesn’t seem to get the traction or reaction you expected.</p><p>

Our Digital Advocacy for Social Change programme is the revolutionary approach which cost effectively addresses this issue.</p><p>

There are any number of ways of approaching digital advocacy – we outline a few below, please contact us for more detail.</p><p>

Best is to take an example, and show you what we would do.  First, we’ll take a policy example, then a social one.</p>

<h3>Research and Policy example</h3>
<p>For policy, let’s pick our <a href="{{site.url}}/public_research/2016/06/13/Boko-Haram-Fear-and-Funding-Report.html" target="_blank">Boko Haram study</a>. Now a number of key policy decisions came out of that research, along with a lot of new information on Boko Haram.  It was, after all, the first time that researchers managed to speak to ex Boko Haram fighters in any number!</p><p>

We believe that research and policy have the potential to be change agents, and we strongly believe that we should put citizens at the heart of what we do. Where our clients concur and have the budget,  we use digital advocacy to assist in spreading the message on research and policy.</p><p>

In this example, we would highlight ten key issues and policy decisions.  We would then construct short reports on each of them – aimed directly at citizens in affected areas, and other areas affected by extremism. We may well choose Nigeria, Mali, Chad, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Libya and Egypt.</p><p>

Each piece of work would include a call to change – a behavioural or conceptual change that we feel would be beneficial to the specific situation, belief or concern. We would then use Crimson Hexagon to isolate social media conversation around extremism in those countries, as well as globally.  This would allow us to identify key influencers in the conversation.  These range from media outlets to NGOs to concerned citizens.  These are our key digital advocates. We contact them all, and ask them to assist us in distributing the material via twitter, Facebook and any other digital platforms they may use. In return, we provide our digital advocates with the detail of other advocates, allowing them to collaborate and amplify their own messaging. </p><p>

We release the reports to our Facebook page and make budget available to boost the posts to the countries concerned.  We set a date and timeframe for each report to be released, and simultaneously release them across all our influencers and also on our own platforms. This contsitues a rolling wave of advocacy, as report after report is released, preferably at intervals of a week to allow each to settle before the next one comes out. </p><p>

In this way, the maximum number of people possible can see, access and dissect our material. We also encourage conversation on the various platforms, so a social media advocate can (if budget allows) manage conversation on our various social media platforms.</p><p>

We also approach media outlets (TV, radio, print, online) to distribute, interview etc.</p>

<h4>This is Digital Advocacy for Social Change.</h4>

<h3>Social Example</h3>
<p>For our social example, let’s pick sexism in South Africa (this could though, be almost any country in the world). And let’s just take the example as far as we can, without concerning ourselves with budget.</p><p>

Here, let’s take a social media analytics approach, and work with narrative and counter narrative. We use Crimson Hexagon, and our highly trained and meticulous analysts spend several weeks constructing a comprehensive set of search terms (in recent studies we have used upwards of 2000 search terms).  These are designed to isolate from the total social media conversation all conversation pertaining to a sexist narrative, as well as all those pertaining to a counter narrative to sexism.</p><p>

This then provides us with two sets of data to mine, analyse and report on.  We are able to go back 5 years in our analysis, so we are able to report on the rise (or fall) of sexist conversation on SA social media over time.  We are also able to report on the changing nature of that conversation.  We are able to do the same with the counter narrative.</p><p>

We construct a series of reports – each with a ‘call to change’, that are designed to reflect what citizens are saying on social media back to them – and challenge them to change their behaviour. These form the heart of the digital advocacy on the topic.</p><p>

As with the policy conversation, we are able to work with the most influential digital authors in the counter narrative conversation to assist in disseminating material.</p><p>

So each report is disseminated by us on our Facebook page and through influential authors in the conversation.  As much media attention as can be given to the study is also solicited. In effect this would be an analysis of all sexist ‘talk’ or conversation on South African social media from 2010-2016, and should be of considerable interest to the media.</p><p>

Throughout this process, ancillary material (websites, behaviour change material) can be added to all communication to allow easy access to change oriented communication. </p><p>

<strong>There are then 3 key interventions than can be added onto this work:</strong></p><p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Digital consultancy to pertinent NGOs:</strong> here we analyse the counter narrative conversation and find out where relevant NGOs in the sector sit on the influencer list.  We advise them on where they are placed – then we connect them with other key inlfuencers (individuals, media, other NGOs) to assist in amplifying their message.  We then re-evaluate them monthly after that. We are also able to run analytics on their twitter accounts – see which messages land and which don’t, what their reach is and so on.  This allows us to advise on how best to tailor their messaging.</li>

<li><strong>We construct narrative and counter narrative panels:</strong> as we do our work, we are able to isolate the social media ‘handles’ of individual (citizens, not organisations  or media outlets) contributors to both the narrative and counter narrative conversation.  We are able to turn these into panels several thousand strong, and analyse their social media behaviour over time.  This means that as advocacy work is done, we look to nudge the narrative panel towards the counter narrative panel, with a view to social change.</li>

<li><strong>Live intervention:</strong> probably the apex of this kind of work, we can use our search terms to establish a live feed. In an unlimited budget scenario, this could be done globally as easily as it could be done by country.  This live feed would alert us in real time to any sexist language being used on twitter especially, but also on public Facebook and Instagram accounts.  A dedicated analyst would immediately respond, adding the hashtag used to the response, thereby directly impacting on the tone of conversation.  We would set up a variety of responses based on the nature of the conversation/language used. Again, change oriented website links can be included in all communication. Interaction with ‘offenders’ would necessarily be done sensitively, with a view to nudging behaviour rather  than antagonising.

<p>Below, we show a single case study on the kind of reach that digital advocacy can have.</p>
<h3>THE CASE STUDY OUTLINE AND RESULTS WERE AS FOLLOWS:</h3>
<p><img class='fadeinleft' src='{{site.url}}/images/chart.jpg'></p><p>
We spent R1000 (approximately 75 US$) on boosting the single Facebook piece to relevant countries on our Facebook page (we have 96 000 African followers). The countries we boosted this to were Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, Chad (directly affected), Mali and Somalia (who also suffer from insurgency). The results were astonishing:</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
It was presented to 566 036 users</li>
<li>The link was clicked 27 538 times</li>
<li>We had 18500 unique visits to our website</li>
<li>It was shared 615 times</li>
</p>
<p><img class='fadeinleft' src='{{site.url}}/images/bokoharam.png'></p><p>
<p>These results represent an astonishing level of penetration and reach. The level of engagement is an indication of the relevancy of the information and the eagerness of the audience for this type of content. The flexible nature of this model - dependent on budget, depth of research and volume of content produced for distribution - makes it incredibly scalable. The potential impact is immeasurable.</p><p>
