      <p>If you work in advocacy you probably know the feeling of struggling to get your message out there.  Our digital advocacy programme can help.</p><p>
We work on individual advocacy issues to develop and distribute content with a view to nudging peoples behaviours structural beliefs or to informing the public on relevant issues. We can tackle any progressive advocacy concern – form the structural (racism, sexism etc) to the information led (extremism, refugees, education, health etc) to the particular (Boko Haram,  Brexit etc).</p><p>
In order to produce content, we use Opinion – our social media research analytics tool powered by Crimson Hexagon.  We isolate an issue, produce 5-6 tailored research pieces on it and then use our social media network to distribute it.</p>

We are convinced that our Digital Advocacy work provides the best possible way to analyse ad reflect citizen’s perceptions, nudge or inform citizens about pertinent causes and provide unparalleled distribution of pertinent, original material on almost any progressive cause.</p><p>
We have run a case study on Boko Haram at our own cost to prove our case. A full study might look at – the rise of fear, perceptions around funding, perceptions around why people join, the main drivers of radicalisation,  personal stories and so on.  We focused on two of these, the rise of fear and perceptions around how Bokop Haram is funded.

        <p>The case study outline and results were as follows:</p>
        <p><ol><li>We constructed a monitor on Crimson Hexagon looking at all social media traffic in Nigeria from 2011 to the study date in late 2015 – isolating over 1 billion social media posts.</li>
          <li>We trained this monitor to look for 2 distinct data sets  <ul><li>Issues of socio economic concern to Nigerians, with a view to seeing how the Rise of Fear has grown over the last five years</li><li>Social media conversations around how Boko Haram is funded, with a view to evaluating Nigerians opinions in this regard</li></ul></li>
         <li>We used Crimson Hexagon to analyse this data – producing three main  bodies of work: <ul><li>A piece of research that showed how Fear of Personal safety had grown from less that 1% of the conversation in 2011 to 22% of the conversation in 2015 – growing to the point that it far outweighed all  other socio-economic concerns in Nigeria in 2015</li><li>A piece of research that showed that (pre-Buhari) 54% of conversation around Boko Haram funding pointed the finger firmly at government, politicians and the ‘big men’ of Nigeria</li><li>.       A set of timelines (2011-2015) showing conversation peaks and troughs around Boko haram funding conversation, with desk research evaluating why these occurred.</li></ul></li><li>We then constructed a single, abbreviated social media oriented piece of research which we published on our website. <a href="{{site.url}}/public_research/2016/06/13/Boko-Haram-Fear-and-Funding-Report.html">Click here</a> for the Boko Haram Fear and Funding report.
</li><li>We moved from being content creators to content distributors, and placed the research piece on Facebook – using our community of 60 000 (and growing) followers. See the post <a href="{{site.url}}/public_research/2016/06/13/Boko-Haram-Fear-and-Funding-Report.html" target="_blank">here</a></li><li>We spent R1000 (approximately 75 US$) on boosting the piece to relevant countries, and the results were astonishing: <ul><li>It was presented to 450 000 users</li><li>The link was clicked 25 000 times</li><li>We had 12 500 unique visits to our website</li><li>It was shared 550 times</li></ul></li></ol></p>
      <p>These results represent an astonishing level of penetration and reach, and constitute an almost viral response to the post.  Imagine 6 consecutive pieces of research, each with a budget of 750 dollars!
We will also shortly be launching our twitter distribution network – here we isolate key contributors to the conversation that we have reported on (we can generate thousands of these handles) and use them to assist in distributing material.  We then use Crimson Hexagon to track how successful the twitter post has been.</p><p>
 
If you represent an advocacy group or an organisation dedicated to informing the public on issues of concern please contact us.  We stress that our politics are progressive, and only advocacy towards progressive goals will be considered.
