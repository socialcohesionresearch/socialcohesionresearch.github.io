      <p>Opinion is our online analytics tool, developed through our partnership with <a href="http://www.crimsonhexagon.com/" target="_blank">Crimson Hexagon</a>, arguably the best social media storage and analytics tool in the world. Opinion is the tool we use to deliver our own Twitter Activity Index and our Social Cohesion Index, and all our social media research for our clients.
Crimson Hexagon has stored the entire world’s conversation on social media from 2008 – almost 1 trillion pieces of social media data. This allows us to run retrospective longitudinal studies – invaluable in the world of social research.</p>
<p>Crimson Hexagon’s proprietary array of analytics tools allows us to analyse this massive data set. Using algorithms and adaptive learning it can process and analyse billions of tweets, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and blog posts – sorting and making sense of the conversation.  We can run this analysis by country, region or globally – in multiple languages.</p>
<p>At the Citizen Research Centre, we have successfully applied the power of Crimson Hexagon to our social research work.</p> 
<p>We are always looking at what people are saying about an issue, or how they are feeling about a topic.  We can answer practically any question - from the general to the specific; from the conceptual to the practical.</p>
<p>Boko Haram in Nigeria; AQIM in Mali; ISIS globally; the refugee crisis in Europe; Ebola in West Africa;  socio-economic concerns in Nigeria; the refugee crisis in Europe; diabetes; service delivery in South Africa; corruption in Nigeria; sexism globally; regional identity in Europe; the rise of the right in Europe; what is being said about Donald Trump?</p>
<p>The amazing thing about social media data is that it is simultaneously quantitative and qualitative, and both will always be included in our reporting.  The macro and the micro come standard!</p>
<p>It is quantitative in that, even with a very specific topic we meaningfully access and analyse anything from hundreds of thousands to millions of pieces of social media data.</p> 
<p>It is qualitative in that the more we drill down the more we are able to explore what individual citizens say about specific topics of interest. Personal stories abound - what did individual people say - about specific topics, at specific times and in specific contexts.</p>
<p>Our platform can answer almost any question, if framed as follows:</p>
<p><strong>What do people who are active on social media in any given country/region or globally feel or think about any topic of interest.</strong></p> 
<p>Some of our clients have raised concerns about privacy. We assure you that all the information analysed on Crimson Hexagon by the Citizen Research Centre is information that has been placed in the public domain. All twitter posts are intended for public consumption, and only open posts from other social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and blogs) are available for analysis.</p> 
<p>Being the only organisation in the world currently using Crimson Hexagon this way, we are pretty excited about what we do and how we do it!</p>
