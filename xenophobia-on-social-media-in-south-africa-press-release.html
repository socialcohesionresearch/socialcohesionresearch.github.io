 <p>We would love for you to publish as much of this story as you can.  We are available for interviews – either for print, radio or TV. A more comprehensive report is available on our <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/public_research/2017/03/15/xenophobia-on-social-media-in-south-africa.html">website</a>.</p>
<p>For this study, we have taken the entire public social media conversation pertaining to Xenophobia. Looking at only content originating from South Africa, we are able to segment the data into conversation themes and specific categories.</p>

<p><strong>Our goals are to obtain funding to do the following:</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>Publish the full results: year by year detailed reporting from 2011-2016, and then on an annual ongoing basis</li>
  <li>Construct a live environment in which we engage with inflammatory and potentially harmful social media content on an ongoing basis</li>
  <li>Implement this process for xenophobia, homophobia, racism and sexism to drive full system social cohesion.</li>
</ul>
</ul></p>
<p>To this end this is a marketing exercise for us, as much as it is a public service. We ask, therefore, that the following accreditation is given to any stories:
</p>
<p><i><a href="www.citizenresearchcentre.org" target="_blank">The Citizen Research Centre</a> conducts research on social media in the public interest, in partnership with Crimson Hexagon. They have recently published extensive material on the conversation on xenophobia on social media in South Africa. They hope to secure funding to complete this work, engage in dialogue on social media to help ‘reduce the temperature’, and to repeat the process for racism, sexism and homophobia.

 <h2 style="color: #2e74b5;">Background:</h2>
 <p><ul>
<li>We use an analytics platform called Crimson Hexagon, arguably the best of its kind globally, to conduct social media based research on topics of public interest. Crimson Hexagon has stored the world’s public social media data since 2008 – over 1 trillion pieces of social media data. </li>
  <li>We can only ‘see’ and analyse public data, across twitter, facebook, tumblr, Instagram, blogs, chat rooms and web sites.</li>
    <li>We go through an exhaustive process on the platform to isolate the data we want to look at. We then trawl through thousands and thousands of pieces of data, and categorise them into the themes that emerge. 
</li>
      <li>We ask the algorithm to analyse the data going back to 2011, and it does that to a 98% accuracy level. South African social media only became ubiquitous enough to analyse in from 2011.</li>
        <li>In this case, we isolated all social media content relating to xenophobia in South Africa – selecting a research period spanning from 2011 to present day.
</li>
          <li>The xenophobic conversation comprised over 10 million posts from 2011 to present day. News reports and international xenophobia made up almost 80% of the conversation, which we excluded. We looked at the other 20% - all social media posts about South African xenophobia, and driven by individuals rather than media outlets.</li>
            <li>We were then working with a data set of 2.3 million posts since 2011. 
</li>
              <li>Volumes ranged from 195 000 social media posts on the topic in 2014 to 542 000 in 2015.  2015 represented the highest volume by far – due to the comments made by Goodwill Zwelethini, and subsequent violence in KZN and then the rest of the country. The average daily number of posts over the year was 1483 per day, but during the period of the violence averaged 5670.
</li>
                <li>The whole of 2016 saw 234 000 posts on xenophobia at an average of 640 per day.  </li>
                  <li>In the first 2 months of 2017, we have already seen over 115 000 posts, at an average of 1958 per day. 
</li>
                    <li>We run an Organized Interference Monitor – this looks for interference from individuals or organizations, and showed that on average there were no more than 3 contributions to the conversation made by any individual.  We’re able to conclude from this that there was not widescale organized interference in this conversation.</li>
                      <li>It is in looking at the nature of the conversation that certain trends emerge. We looked at 9 themes within the conversation, and how they change over time.
</li>
 </ul></p>
 <h2 style="color: #2e74b5;">The following themes emerged:</h2>
 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;">PROVOCATION (PRO-XENOPHOBIA)</h3>
 <ol>
<li>Pro-Xenophobia/Violence - outright xenophobia or condoning/support of violence as the answer
</li>
<li>Anti-Immigrant - hateful anti-immigrant rhetoric
</li>
<li>Anti-Crime/Drug/Prostitution - violent, confrontational or accusatory rhetoric focused on crime</li>
 </ol>

  <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;">PACIFICATION (ANTI-XENOPHOBIA)</h3>
 <ol>
<li>Anti-Xenophobic - speaking out against xenophobia
</li>
<li>Anti-Violence - speaking out against physical violence, intimidation, looting etc.
</li>
<li>Not All Foreigners - anti-xenophobia posts postulating that the transgressors are a small minority</li>
 </ol>

   <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;">NUANCED OPINION</h3>
 <ol>
<li>Problem Finding / Finger Pointing - posts concerned with either casting blame or solution finding
</li>
<li>Anti-Xeno/Violence, Anti-Crime/Drug/Prostitution – condemning xenophobia or violence, and/or supporting immigrants while being anti-crime/drugs/prostitution
</li>
<li>Anti - White / Colonial – anti-xenophobic rhetoric shifting the focus to ‘the real enemy’ – colonialism or white South Africans </li>
 </ol>

 <h3 style="color: #2e74b5;">The Data by theme and across all years is as follows:</h3>

<ol>
<li>All provocation includes incitement to violence and also what we would define as hate speech. Provocation comprises between 8% and 28% of the conversation depending on the year, and is lowest as a proportion of conversation during crises. </li>
<li>An important aspect of provocation is the more recent tendency to associate foreigners with criminal activity. This has been aggravated by Herman Mashaba’s recent comments. As a result, hateful speech associated with crime rose from 4% of the conversation before his comments to a high of 13% of the conversation. The implication is clear – statements by politicians are amplified on social media, and used by xenophobes to justify their position.  
</li>
<li>What we would classify as extreme hate speech and incitement to violence remains a fairly small component of the total conversation, peaking at 4% of the conversation.  In total numbers, though, this is seriously problematic: <ul>
<li>4% in 2015 was 21 660 posts, and this year at only 1% it is still over 1 100 posts in 2 months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The implication here is that we need to be monitoring and contributing to this conversation consistently – both as concerned citizens and as politicians, and not only when incitement to violence has actually led to violence. </li>

<strong>About Crimson Hexagon and CRC Opinion</strong>
<br><br>
<p><a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/how-we-do-it/opinion.html" target="_blank"><strong>Opinion</strong></a> is our online analytics tool, developed through our partnership with <a href="http://www.crimsonhexagon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Crimson Hexagon</strong></a>, arguably the best social media storage and analytics tool in the world. Opinion is the tool we use to deliver our own Twitter Activity Index and our Social Cohesion Index, and all our social media research for our clients. Crimson Hexagon has stored the entire world’s conversation on social media from 2008 – <strong>over 1 trillion pieces of social media data</strong>. This allows us to run retrospective longitudinal studies – invaluable in the world of social research.
</p><p>
Crimson Hexagon’s proprietary array of analytics tools allows us to analyse this massive data set. Using algorithms and adaptive learning it can process and analyse billions of tweets, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, forum, chat room, comments and blog posts – sorting and making sense of the conversation. We can run this analysis by country, region or globally – in multiple languages.
</p><p>
At the Citizen Research Centre, we have successfully applied the power of Crimson Hexagon to our social research work.
</p><p>
We are always looking at what people are saying about an issue, or how they feel about a topic. We can answer practically any question - from the general to the specific; from the conceptual to the practical.
</p><p>
<strong>Bear in mind that social media data is the only data we have that is unsolicited</strong>. We are not asking people to answer questions, as in all other forms of research – <strong>we are looking at what they have said and are saying</strong>. So while it has its limitations, its power lies in its sheer size, its retrospective nature and in the honesty that comes from unsolicited data.
</p><p>
In essence, what can be observed is limitless with topics such as the following all being accessible: sexism, homophobia, xenophobia in any country; Boko Haram in Nigeria; AQIM in Mali; ISIS globally; the refugee crisis in Europe; Ebola in West Africa; socio-economic concerns in Nigeria; the refugee crisis in Europe; diabetes; public violence and service delivery in South Africa; corruption in Nigeria; sexism globally; regional identity in Europe; the rise of the right in Europe; what is being said about Donald Trump? (and much much more!)
</p><p>
Once a target area of research is identified, a process of determining exactly how (and what) individuals are saying about the topic. From this, a detailed set of search phases are determined and rapidly tested and iterated upon to these ensures data reliability, completeness and limitation of erroneous data.
</p><p>
Once we have isolated the data, we can engage in three parallel processes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Digital Advocacy for Social Change</strong>: here we reflect back to citizens what they themselves are saying/thinking on social media (supported by further desktop research). This is designed either to inform or to challenge and change behaviour. We use Facebook, Twitter and traditional news sources to distribute this material, and engage digital advocates in this effort.  See more <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/digital-advocacy-for-social-change.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Live streaming and response</strong>: with health or social change subjects especially we are able to isolate and live stream any comments – and then respond to them in a dialogue led intervention process. Unlike traditional interventions, a single (small) team is able to engage, in real-time, with anybody in any target region - without causing cost escalation.</li>
  <li><strong>Social media panels</strong>: we are able to isolate protagonists from the ‘general population’ and establish bespoke social media panels. These allow us to retrospectively analyse their data and analyse it going forward.  This way we are able to evaluate the effect of intervention measures.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The amazing thing about social media data is that it is simultaneously quantitative and qualitative, and both will always be included in our reporting. The macro and the micro come standard!
</p><p>
It is quantitative in that, even with a very specific topic we meaningfully access and analyse anything from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions of pieces of social media data.
</p><p>
It is qualitative in that the more we drill down the more we are able to explore what individual citizens say about specific topics of interest. Personal stories abound - what did individual people say - about specific topics, at specific times and in specific contexts.
</p><p>
Our platform can answer almost any question if framed as follows:
</p><p>
<strong>What do people who are active on social media in any given country/region (or globally) feel or think about any topic of interest?</strong>
</p><p>
Some of our clients have raised concerns about privacy. We assure you that all the information analysed on Crimson Hexagon by the Citizen Research Centre is information that has been placed in the public domain. All twitter posts are intended for public consumption, and only open posts from other social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, comments, forums and blogs) are available for analysis.
</p><p>
We are reliably informed by Crimson Hexagon themselves that we are the only organisation in the world currently using Crimson Hexagon in this way.
