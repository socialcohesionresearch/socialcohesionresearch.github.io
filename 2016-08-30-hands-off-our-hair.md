    <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>On Saturday, 27 August, high school students from Pretoria Girls held a peaceful protest during the school’s annual Spring Fair. The march was organised by some of the year 8 students but was joined by Tuks students, old-girls from Pretoria Girls High and members of the public. In response, the school called on armed police, private security and a K9 unit - which saw the situation receive considerable traditional media and social media attention.

<p>We analysed all South African social media from Friday 26 August to Monday 29 August and found 71,048 pieces of content related to the StopRacismAtPretoriaGirlsHigh issue - more than 99% of which were tweets.
</p>
<h3>Growth in Engagement</h3>
<p>The engagement was at it’s lowest on the day of the protest with only 94 tweets, compared to 185 the day before. The issue quickly drew and the volumes increased on Sunday to 16,673 and again on Monday with 54,096.

<p>According to the Citizen Research Centre, the top 4 countries in Africa accounted for 81% of all twitter volume on the continent.</p> 

<p>The Top 4 countries by volume of tweets were Egypt, South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya – sending out just over 1 billion tweets between them in 2015. The remaining 48 countries sent ‘just’ 232 million tweets.</p>

<div id="voltweets" style="min-width: 275px; height: 400px; margin: 0 auto"></div>

<p>The variance between the top and bottom countries is stark – Egypt sent out 344 397 013 tweets in 2015, with the bottom ranked country by volume – Equatorial Guinea – sending out just 7 470 tweets in the same period.</p>

<p>Even in the Top 5 countries by volume the fall off is dramatic.  The fourth highest country by volume – Kenya – sent 173 785 414 tweets in 2015.  The fifth highest country by volume – Ghana – sent less than a 5th of that number - 34 719 648.</p>  

<div id="voltweetstop" style="min-width: 275px; height: 400px; margin: 0 auto"></div>

<h3>Language</h3>

<p>Of all tweets sent out by Africans in 2015, 58% were in English, 29% in Arabic, only 3.5 % in French and less than 1 percent in Portuguese. Crimson Hexagon does not ‘read’ any indigenous African languages, but we can assume that they comprise most of the 9% of tweets that could be characterised as ‘other’. These languages have grown in use from 2% of the conversation in 2011 to 9% in 2015.</p>

<div id="language" style="min-width: 275px; height: 400px; margin: 0 auto"></div>

<p>In terms of volume, North African countries are prominent in the top 15 – with all of Egypt (1st), Algeria (6th), Morocco (7th), Libya (8th) and Tunisia (11th) represented in the top 15 countries by volume.</p>



<h3>Activity</h3>

<p>Activity levels are different to volume levels in that they look at the number of tweets sent per member of the population. Here South Africa emerged as the most active African country on twitter, with South Africans sending 4.7 tweets per member of the population in 2015. Egypt ranked second with 3.9 and Kenya third with 3.7 tweets per citizen.</p>

<p>Botswana, the Seychelles, Namibia and Mauritius all performed well on an activity level.  They ranked 4th, 5th, 7th and 8th respectively. All have populations under three million with relatively concentrated urban populations. All also have well developed tourist economies, which also helps explain their high levels of activity relative to their populations. Crimson Hexagon identifies where tweets come from, so any tweets sent by tourists while in these countries would register as tweets sent from that country.</p>

<div id="top10activity" style="min-width: 275px; height: 400px; margin: 0 auto"></div>

<p>The difference between viewing twitter by activity rather than volume is best illustrated by Nigeria – which ranks 3rd on volume, but given its huge population of 183 million ranks 9th on activity.</p>

<p>All of these numbers pale in comparison when compared to European figures.  The Citizen Research Centre will release its European Index shortly. But a sneak preview shows that the highest volume European country is the United Kingdom, which sent in excess of 5.5 billion tweets in 2015. This is a rate of 87 tweets per member of the population in 2015. This makes citizens in the UK almost 20 times as active as the most active African country (South Africa).</p>
