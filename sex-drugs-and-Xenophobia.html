 <h2 style="color: #2e74b5;">Overview</h2>
 <p>Xenophobia continues to be an issue that divides opinion amongst South Africans. Our research aims to better understand the layered narratives taking place online with an aim of affecting positive change through big data insights.</p>
<p>For this study, we have taken the entire public social media conversation pertaining to Xenophobia. Looking at only content originating from South Africa, we are able to segment the data into conversation themes and specific categories.</p>

<p>Our research focuses on developing a clear overview of the following data:</p>
<p><ul>
  <li>A general overview of content from 2011 to present.</li>
  <li>Xenophobia Pacification</li>
  <li>Nuanced Opinion</li>
  <li>Xenophobia Provocation</li>
  <li>Insights into Conversation Data</li>
  <li>A specific focus on 2017 Xenophobia</li>
  <li>Understanding Influencers</li>
  <li>Overview of Content Volume (Year on Year)</li>
  <li>Where the conversation is taking place</li>
  <li>What topics are being discussed?</li>
  <li>Which content is most popular</li>
  <li>A focus on divergent themes including:</li>
  <ul><li>Drugs</li>
<li>Prostitution</li>
<li>The Police</li>
<li>Politics</li>
<li>Anti-White / Anti-Colonial</li>
</ul>
</ul></p>

<strong>About Crimson Hexagon and CRC Opinion</strong>
<br><br>
<p><a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/how-we-do-it/opinion.html" target="_blank"><strong>Opinion</strong></a> is our online analytics tool, developed through our partnership with <a href="http://www.crimsonhexagon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Crimson Hexagon</strong></a>, arguably the best social media storage and analytics tool in the world. Opinion is the tool we use to deliver our own Twitter Activity Index and our Social Cohesion Index, and all our social media research for our clients. Crimson Hexagon has stored the entire world’s conversation on social media from 2008 – <strong>over 1 trillion pieces of social media data</strong>. This allows us to run retrospective longitudinal studies – invaluable in the world of social research.
</p><p>
Crimson Hexagon’s proprietary array of analytics tools allows us to analyse this massive data set. Using algorithms and adaptive learning it can process and analyse billions of tweets, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, forum, chat room, comments and blog posts – sorting and making sense of the conversation. We can run this analysis by country, region or globally – in multiple languages.
</p><p>
At the Citizen Research Centre, we have successfully applied the power of Crimson Hexagon to our social research work.
</p><p>
We are always looking at what people are saying about an issue, or how they feel about a topic. We can answer practically any question - from the general to the specific; from the conceptual to the practical.
</p><p>
<strong>Bear in mind that social media data is the only data we have that is unsolicited</strong>. We are not asking people to answer questions, as in all other forms of research – <strong>we are looking at what they have said and are saying</strong>. So while it has its limitations, its power lies in its sheer size, its retrospective nature and in the honesty that comes from unsolicited data.
</p><p>
In essence, what can be observed is limitless with topics such as the following all being accessible: sexism, homophobia, xenophobia in any country; Boko Haram in Nigeria; AQIM in Mali; ISIS globally; the refugee crisis in Europe; Ebola in West Africa; socio-economic concerns in Nigeria; the refugee crisis in Europe; diabetes; public violence and service delivery in South Africa; corruption in Nigeria; sexism globally; regional identity in Europe; the rise of the right in Europe; what is being said about Donald Trump? (and much much more!)
</p><p>
Once a target area of research is identified, a process of determining exactly how (and what) individuals are saying about the topic. From this, a detailed set of search phases are determined and rapidly tested and iterated upon to these ensures data reliability, completeness and limitation of erroneous data.
</p><p>
Once we have isolated the data, we can engage in three parallel processes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Digital Advocacy for Social Change</strong>: here we reflect back to citizens what they themselves are saying/thinking on social media (supported by further desktop research). This is designed either to inform or to challenge and change behaviour. We use Facebook, Twitter and traditional news sources to distribute this material, and engage digital advocates in this effort.  See more <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/digital-advocacy-for-social-change.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Live streaming and response</strong>: with health or social change subjects especially we are able to isolate and live stream any comments – and then respond to them in a dialogue led intervention process. Unlike traditional interventions, a single (small) team is able to engage, in real-time, with anybody in any target region - without causing cost escalation.</li>
  <li><strong>Social media panels</strong>: we are able to isolate protagonists from the ‘general population’ and establish bespoke social media panels. These allow us to retrospectively analyse their data and analyse it going forward.  This way we are able to evaluate the effect of intervention measures.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The amazing thing about social media data is that it is simultaneously quantitative and qualitative, and both will always be included in our reporting. The macro and the micro come standard!
</p><p>
It is quantitative in that, even with a very specific topic we meaningfully access and analyse anything from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions of pieces of social media data.
</p><p>
It is qualitative in that the more we drill down the more we are able to explore what individual citizens say about specific topics of interest. Personal stories abound - what did individual people say - about specific topics, at specific times and in specific contexts.
</p><p>
Our platform can answer almost any question if framed as follows:
</p><p>
<strong>What do people who are active on social media in any given country/region (or globally) feel or think about any topic of interest?</strong>
</p><p>
Some of our clients have raised concerns about privacy. We assure you that all the information analysed on Crimson Hexagon by the Citizen Research Centre is information that has been placed in the public domain. All twitter posts are intended for public consumption, and only open posts from other social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, comments, forums and blogs) are available for analysis.
</p><p>
We are reliably informed by Crimson Hexagon themselves that we are the only organisation in the world currently using Crimson Hexagon in this way.
