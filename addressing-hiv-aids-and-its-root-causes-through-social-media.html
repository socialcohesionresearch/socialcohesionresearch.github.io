<p>Imagine thousands of digital activists, progressively being trained in mediation and dialogue, and armed with facts and strategies around a host of societal issues – all working with us on social media platforms.</p><p>

Imagine a 16-year-old girl tweets that she is thinking of dropping out of school. In real time, a dialogue facilitator tweets her back, linking her into two digital activists, both of whom have recently finished school and have spoken glowingly about their experience on social media.  They pick up a conversation with the young girl, speak to her about why she is doing this, and try to dissuade her.</p><p>

Imagine a 15-year-old girl tweets about her boyfriend being reluctant to use condoms. In real time, a dialogue facilitator tweets her back, linking her into two digital activists, both of whom have recently spoken on social media about how they persuaded their boyfriends to use condoms.  They pick up a conversation with the young girl and share tips and strategies with her.
</p><p>
This is the kind of work we hope to do.</p>
<h3 style="color: #2e74b5;">Deliverables (overview):</h3>
<p>This concept note aims to show how we can deliver the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Analysis of 22 contributing factors to HIV/AIDS</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Selection of 10 most pertinent of these for research, engagement and implementation</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Comprehensive analysis of the volume and nature of social media data on each of these factors </strong>on South African social media over the last 5 years</li>
  <li><strong>Comprehensive reporting on each contributing factor: providing benchmarking and also an opportunity for public engagement and digital advocacy</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Ongoing reporting on all 10 contributing factors</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Develop and up-skilling a crowd-sourced network of Digital Activists: initially within each ‘factor’, over time crossing over the various factors. </strong>Here we identify people on social media that have expressed an interest in a contributing factor, engage with them and use them as digital activists to effect behavioural change.</li>
  <li><strong>Ten comprehensive live interventions into the 10 contributing factors </strong>on social media in South Africa going forward. Here we link our digital activists to ‘person at risk’ on social media, and facilitate thousands of conversations aimed at assisting ‘persona at risk’ to make appropriate behavioural choices.</li>
  <li><strong>A bank of social media panels</strong> – to evaluate and monitor the effect of our programmes</li>
  <li><strong>An array of online dialogue and mediation tools</strong> designed to facilitate dialogue and upskill digital activists.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="color: #2e74b5;">Background and Strategy:</h3>
<p>HIV/AIDS remains arguably the most urgent health concern in South Africa, and this is especially true of young, black South African women.
</p><p>
Interventions are manifold – from education through to technology/science oriented interventions such as the development of a vaccine. Yet HIV/AIDS rates of infection remain stubbornly high owing to a host of factors.
</p><p>
While diabetes is a lifestyle disease, HIV/AIDS is in the main a behavioural disease. This is a simplification, as coercive sex and other non-consensual or partly consensual factors are always involved. However, inter-generational sex, transactional sex, unsafe sex, dry sex, various taboos and myths and a sense of fatalism/despair all contribute. In addition, ‘root cause’ decisions like leaving school early eventually have an impact.
</p><p>
This proposal provides a solution to those components of behaviour that are rooted in choice.  In addition, it looks at some of the root or peripheral causes of contracting HIV/AIDS and looks to encourage behavioural change around these causative decisions/behaviours.
</p><p>
It looks to do all of this through the use of social media – first through identifying and analysing causative behaviour expressed online, and then crucially through sparking discussions aimed at nudging or changing behaviour/decisions over time.
</p><p>
Of course, not all citizens use social media – but many do, especially amongst the youth. South Africa is the most active social media country on the continent, with over 250 million tweets sent in 2015.
</p><p>
Using social media, and in collaboration with <a href="https://www.crimsonhexagon.com/" target="_blank">Crimson Hexagon</a> and the Foundation, <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/" target="_blank">The Citizen Research Centre</a> will engage in a range of social media-oriented activities aimed at changing, moderating or enabling public perception on a wide set of focus points.
</p><p>
The intervention aims to encourage targeted, mediated social media conversations around key topics/categories.
</p><p>
We are convinced that the process outlined below allows us the best possible opportunity to harness the power of social media and technology to effect behavioural change. We believe that this process should be pursued as a matter of urgency. We also stress that everything outlined below is measurable and scalable.
</p><p>
Additionally, the process outlined below can easily be exported to other African countries. The only considerations are the volume of social media traffic in any given country (see our <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/africa-twitter-index.html" target="_blank">Africa Twitter Index 2015</a> for details on this) and the volume of local language expression on social media (we would need to hire in-house translators, as well as local facilitators).
</p><p>
<strong><u>Note:</u></strong> while this is the first time that an intervention of this nature has been conducted anywhere in the world, the various components that make up the methodology have previously been used by corporates in various guises.  We are certain that all we detail here is entirely possible. Of course, doing anything for the first time implies elements of risk and of change – to methods and to budgets.  All that we detail is measurable, so as challenges arise and as the scale of the work unfolds, both methodological and budgetary solutions may need to be found to address these.
</p><p>
<strong><u>Note:</u></strong> throughout this document, when referring to analysis, content, mediation, dialogue or activism we are referring to social media content in South Africa.  This refers to all publically available social media content from Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, blogs, comment sections and forums. The analysis is all conducted using Crimson Hexagon (see back of document for more detail), and is all both current (live) and retrospective over a five year period.
</p>
<h3 style="color: #2e74b5;">Methodology:</h3>
<p>We will use our social media analytics tool, <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/how-we-do-it/opinion.html" target="_blank"><strong>Opinion</strong></a> - developed through our partnership with <a href="http://www.crimsonhexagon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Crimson Hexagon</strong></a>, arguably the best social media storage and analytics tool in the world. Opinion is the tool we use to deliver our own <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/africa-twitter-index.html" target="_blank">African Twitter Activity Index</a> and all our social media research for our clients. We also produce smaller, periodic pieces of <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/public-reports.html" target="_blank">work for the public</a>, and use the tool to engage in <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/digital-advocacy-for-social-change.html" target="_blank">digital advocacy for social change</a>.
</p><p>
Crimson Hexagon has stored the entire world’s conversation on social media from 2008 – <strong>over 1 trillion pieces of social media data</strong>. This allows us to run retrospective longitudinal studies – invaluable in the world of social research.
</p><p>
Crimson Hexagon’s proprietary array of analytics tools allows us to analyse this massive data set. Using algorithms and adaptive learning it can process and analyse billions of tweets, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, forum, chat room, comments and blog posts – sorting and making sense of the conversation. We can run this analysis by country, region or globally – in multiple languages.
</p><p>
At the Citizen Research Centre, we have successfully applied the power of Crimson Hexagon to our social research work.
</p>
<h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><u>Approach and Process: </u></h3>
<h4 style="color: #2e74b5;">1.  Research</h4>
<h4 style="color: #2e74b5;">2.  Engagement</h4>
<h4 style="color: #2e74b5;">3.  Implementation</h4>
<h4 style="color: #2e74b5;">4.  Monitoring and Evaluation</h4>
<p>The process we propose engaging in is multi-layered, though certain elements can run simultaneously.
</p><p>
<strong>Note: we sometimes refer to ‘contributing factors’ as ‘categories’. </strong>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<h4 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Research:</strong></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The research &amp; instrument building phase is intensive during the first 3 months; after that monthly reports are delivered.
</p>
<strong>Identification Stage:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Tackling an issue like HIV/AIDS on social media has to, by necessity, be oblique. The stigma associated with the condition has been well documented, and we do not expect people to talk openly about it on social media.</li>
  <li>There are, though, a host of contributing factors to South Africa’s HIV/AIDS rate, and it is by addressing each of these individually that we can provide meaningful and useful longitudinal data; a ready source of material for effective digital advocacy and a live streaming service in which dialogue practitioners, counsellors and the like can engage directly with people at risk.</li>
  <li>In the Identification Stage, we construct search terms for all social media traffic on as many as 22 contributing factors, with a view to narrowing them down to 10 to take forward. We have identified the following, but the team may well have additional factors we should address.</li>
  <li>NOTE: IF we find that more than 10 of these factors are pertinent, we should consider including them in the following stages of this programme.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sexism: </strong>we use this term broadly, but there are likely to be strands of conversation that are pertinent. In fact, <strong>providing women with the knowledge, skills and strategies to counter sexist behaviour </strong>by men should perhaps be considered a cornerstone of this project.</li>
  <li><strong>Blessers</strong> and all associated terms: intergenerational and transactional sex remain critical factors in transmission and have become mainstream</li>
  <li><strong>Unsafe sex</strong>: online mentions of the various direct unsafe sexual practices.</li>
  <li><strong>Male condom resistance</strong>: expressed both by women and by men, and treated separately</li>
  <li><strong>Coercive sex</strong>: expressed both by women and by men, and treated separately</li>
  <li><strong>Anal sex</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Sexual Debut: </strong>considering having sex for the first time (especially early)</li>
  <li><strong>Dry sex:</strong> extremely important dynamic in SA</li>
  <li><strong>Dropping out of school</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Mining for myths:</strong> eg: Depo-Provera can ‘close the womb’</li>
  <li><strong>Invasive genital washing</strong> (washing at all, but also with products like Dettol and Sunlight Green Bar)</li>
  <li><strong>Pregnancy</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Getting tested</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Stigma:</strong> requires some unpacking before we approach this</li>
  <li><strong>Child headed households</strong>: possibly very low volume, but worth investigation</li>
  <li><strong>Immortality complex</strong>: it’ll never happen to me! Again, possibly very low volume, but worth investigation.</li>
  <li><strong>HIV/Aids</strong> itself</li>
  <li><strong>TB</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Polygamy</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Virginity testing</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Prostitution</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Intravenous Drug Use</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>Our highly trained analysts use Crimson Hexagon to identify all public social media posts (twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Instagram,) in South Africa that speak to each if the issues highlighted above.</li>
  <li>Once we have isolated this data, we are able to consider which ten of the contributing factors to take forward. This will depend on traffic (volume), the nature of the social media engagement around each issue and the potential for intervention in a live environment (<strong>implementation</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<strong>Research Stage:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>We then, for each of the ten contributing factors being taken forward, analyse and report on all data backdated by 5 years.
<ul>
  <li>This provides benchmarking (conversation on a category as a proportion of total) on a five-year basis and allows us to both predict and assess future data.</li>
  <li>Produce extensive reporting on the nature of conversation within each contributing factor over the last five years – how they have changed over time, what the discussion in each of the categories have been about and so on.</li>
  <li>This categorisation is important – both for reporting and for use in the implementation phase of the project. Different categories will be responded to differently – depending on the nature of the conversation.</li>
  <li>The public face of the programme can be established through this work. Easily digestible data and trends can be communicated to the public – both via traditional and social media channels. We have extensive media contacts, and we are sure that you do too!</li>
  <li>Trends can be reported on, distributed to media and so on. Episodic work of interest to the public can be distributed.</li>
  <li><u>We are committed to reflecting citizens views back to them, and challenging them on these views</u> – and Digital Advocacy can assist in spreading positive messaging and change-oriented challenges to citizens. See our <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/digital-advocacy-for-social-change.html" target="_blank">digital advocacy programme</a> for more detail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
  <li><h4 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Engagement:</strong></h4></li>
</ol>
<p>The Engagement Phase is Ongoing: starting with large scale engagement and followed by carefully curating, maintaining, upskilling and refreshing the digital activist community
</p>
<ul>
  <li>While we construct the Boolean (an exhaustive series of if/then constructs) search terms for the various contributing factors/categories and report on them over the last 5 years, we engage in a parallel process that is crucial to the project.</li>
  <li>As we look at conversations, we are able to identify an exhaustive list of ALL the people that participated in those conversations – twitter handles, Facebook profiles, Instagram accounts and so on.</li>
  <li>We are also able to rank these participants according to their level of influence in the conversation.</li>
  <li>While we are looking at the conversation within each category, we uncover two strands of conversation:
<ul>
  <li>Those that are ‘persons at risk’ and</li>
  <li>Those that have tackled the issue in question with a positive outcome</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>It is the latter group of people that become our digital activists.</li>
  <li>The data that we get from our digital activists is excluded from the reporting on the extent of each of the contributing factors, but they become a crucial resource in the following phases of the project.</li>
</ul>
We call this network of digital activists ‘<strong>The Mycorrhiza</strong>’ after the Mycorrhizal Network:
<ul>
  <li>This is an underground <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha">hyphal </a>network created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal" target="_blank">mycorrhizal</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi" target="_blank">fungi</a> that connect individual plants together and transfer water, carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrients and minerals. These are networks in a forest that help trees and plants that are in need– by distributing nutrients to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the engagement phase, we categorise The Mycorrhiza, using whatever demographic data we can glean. The goal is to (as much as possible) link peers in the Implementation phase.
</p><p>
We then engage with them on social media, asking them to join the network, and make material available to them on hidden web pages to ‘arm’ them for the work that follows.
</p><p>
This with a view to engaging and activating citizens in a vast network of ‘citizen society’ – with the intention of effecting social and behavioural change around HIV/AIDS on social media.
</p>
<ol start="3">
  <li><h4 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Implementation:</strong></h4></li>
</ol>
<p>The Implementation Phase is Ongoing
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Implementation Phase, we use the search terms identified in the Research phase, and construct a ‘live environment’.</li>
  <li>This allows us, within each of the ten contributing factor categories, when anyone in South Africa on social media publicly shows themselves to be a ‘person at risk’.</li>
  <li>By this stage, we will have developed exhaustive categorisation protocols, with a range of responses ascribed to each.</li>
  <li>At its heart, though, the live environment will rely on a bank of facilitators engaging with those that are at risk, and ‘tagging’ inappropriate digital activists.</li>
  <li>The crowdsourced facilitators will work from ‘personal’ social media accounts (rather than organisational ones) with an oblique reference to the Mycorrhiza made on their various social media profile pages.  The Mycorrhiza network itself will be represented on a website – we have booked <a href="http://www.mycorrhizals.org" target="_blank">mycorrhizals.org</a>.  This will serve both as a public landing page to absorb attention, as well as a private space to inform and upskill our network of digital activists.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>For all programmes, we are also able to establish online dialogue platforms</strong> and invite people we have identified to participate in them. These provide:
<ul>
  <li>Dedicated online spaces for dialogue and intervention.</li>
  <li>Spaces for mediators to facilitate discussion between relevant peers around topics of interest/concern.</li>
  <li>These are fully customisable and offer powerful tools for sharing experiences, uploading material, generating discussion and effecting change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
  <li><h4 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Monitoring and Evaluation:</strong></h4></li>
</ol>
<p>The Monitoring and Evaluation Phase is Ongoing
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Evaluation panels:</strong> we are able to place all persons of risk that have been engaged as part of this programme into social media evaluation panels. These would natural grow over time.
<ul>
  <li>We are then able to retrospectively and in real-time evaluate all their social media behaviour. This allows us to monitor their ‘progress’ in real time and assesses to what extent our interventions have had an effect – at least in the social media space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li><strong>Reporting</strong>: Monthly reports with considerable detail can be compiled on the ongoing work we do in Implementation.</li>
  <li><strong>KPI monitoring:</strong> Using a range of tools, specific metrics (as agreed in strategy) will be monitored and reported on either daily, weekly or monthly (depending on the metric). In some cases, real-time KPIs will be available.</li>
  <li><strong>An intervention performance dashboard</strong> will be made available for regular check-in with the broader team and to demonstrate forward movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are pertinent with regard to Implementation and moving from Implementation to Monitoring and Evaluation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Write engagement strategy:</strong> for each area of interest, we would write a specific strategy which notes key elements such as: “what does desire (community) behaviour look like?”, “what messaging do we want the community to self-propagate?”, “Who are the key individuals who control the conversation?”, “How best can we use advertising spend to amplify engagements?” as well as specific community metrics to gauge raw community performance across key platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Strengthen in-group:</strong> Working with the community developed during the “Broad Spectrum” phase, the disparate groups are introduced to each other, are offered a strong identity and attempts to unify these groups under a single unifying “banner” are made. A well-defined in-group will self-attract members while actively seeking dialogue with their out-group. <u>See Tajel Social Identity Theory for the theoretical framework. </u></li>
  <li><strong>Build systems for thresholds: </strong>in social psychology, a threshold is the number of in-group members required to cause an individual to behave in alignment with the group. In social media this provides a particularly powerful lever to change behaviour as the “culture” of social media itself is still new, fragile and in rapid evolution. <u>See theory on Thresholds and work by Leor M. Hackel for theoretical framework.</u></li>
  <li><strong>Build facilitator network:</strong> Working with our existing trained facilitators, local communities (such as RLABS) as well as individuals selected from the online community, will be provided with training and brought into the counter-narrative process. This hybrid model ensures we’re able to rapidly build facilitator networks which map to the specific geographies, cultures and languages present in the areas of research.</li>
  <li><strong>Conversation Generation:</strong> Our facilitators engage in a live environment - this engagement is made as casually as possible and from an individual (rather than an organisations) social media account. S/he can introduce a few members of our activist community into conversations playing out in real time. We are then able to monitor the conversation as it unfolds – with our activists being chosen for their views and experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>Deliverables and Timelines: </strong></h3>
<p>While this project is designed to be an ongoing one, we will work to an initial 6-month timeline.  The first 3 months are dedicated to Research, and the second 3 months are dedicated to Engagement, Implementation, Testing and Monitoring and Evaluation.

Basic positive and negative are core emotions relating to being pro or anti a specific topic (i.e. is the conversation being positive or negative towards a particular topic). Joy, sadness, anger and fear all represent the percentage of each emotion within the data for which emotion can be computationally determined.

<h3 style="color: #2e74b5;"><strong>About Crimson Hexagon and CRC Opinion</strong></h3>
<br><br>
<p><a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/how-we-do-it/opinion.html" target="_blank"><strong>Opinion</strong></a> is our online analytics tool, developed through our partnership with <a href="http://www.crimsonhexagon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Crimson Hexagon</strong></a>, arguably the best social media storage and analytics tool in the world. Opinion is the tool we use to deliver our own Twitter Activity Index and our Social Cohesion Index, and all our social media research for our clients. Crimson Hexagon has stored the entire world’s conversation on social media from 2008 – <strong>over 1 trillion pieces of social media data</strong>. This allows us to run retrospective longitudinal studies – invaluable in the world of social research.
</p><p>
Crimson Hexagon’s proprietary array of analytics tools allows us to analyse this massive data set. Using algorithms and adaptive learning it can process and analyse billions of tweets, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, forum, chat room, comments and blog posts – sorting and making sense of the conversation. We can run this analysis by country, region or globally – in multiple languages.
</p><p>
At the Citizen Research Centre, we have successfully applied the power of Crimson Hexagon to our social research work.
</p><p>
We are always looking at what people are saying about an issue, or how they feel about a topic. We can answer practically any question - from the general to the specific; from the conceptual to the practical.
</p><p>
<strong>Bear in mind that social media data is the only data we have that is unsolicited</strong>. We are not asking people to answer questions, as in all other forms of research – <strong>we are looking at what they have said and are saying</strong>. So while it has its limitations, its power lies in its sheer size, its retrospective nature and in the honesty that comes from unsolicited data.
</p><p>
In essence, what can be observed is limitless with topics such as the following all being accessible: sexism, homophobia, xenophobia in any country; Boko Haram in Nigeria; AQIM in Mali; ISIS globally; the refugee crisis in Europe; Ebola in West Africa; socio-economic concerns in Nigeria; the refugee crisis in Europe; diabetes; public violence and service delivery in South Africa; corruption in Nigeria; sexism globally; regional identity in Europe; the rise of the right in Europe; what is being said about Donald Trump? (and much much more!)
</p><p>
Once a target area of research is identified, a process of determining exactly how (and what) individuals are saying about the topic. From this, a detailed set of search phases are determined and rapidly tested and iterated upon to these ensures data reliability, completeness and limitation of erroneous data.
</p><p>
Once we have isolated the data, we can engage in three parallel processes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Digital Advocacy for Social Change</strong>: here we reflect back to citizens what they themselves are saying/thinking on social media (supported by further desktop research). This is designed either to inform or to challenge and change behaviour. We use Facebook, Twitter and traditional news sources to distribute this material, and engage digital advocates in this effort.  See more <a href="http://citizenresearchcentre.org/digital-advocacy-for-social-change.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Live streaming and response</strong>: with health or social change subjects especially we are able to isolate and live stream any comments – and then respond to them in a dialogue led intervention process. Unlike traditional interventions, a single (small) team is able to engage, in real-time, with anybody in any target region - without causing cost escalation.</li>
  <li><strong>Social media panels</strong>: we are able to isolate protagonists from the ‘general population’ and establish bespoke social media panels. These allow us to retrospectively analyse their data and analyse it going forward.  This way we are able to evaluate the effect of intervention measures.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The amazing thing about social media data is that it is simultaneously quantitative and qualitative, and both will always be included in our reporting. The macro and the micro come standard!
</p><p>
It is quantitative in that, even with a very specific topic we meaningfully access and analyse anything from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions of pieces of social media data.
</p><p>
It is qualitative in that the more we drill down the more we are able to explore what individual citizens say about specific topics of interest. Personal stories abound - what did individual people say - about specific topics, at specific times and in specific contexts.
</p><p>
Our platform can answer almost any question if framed as follows:
</p><p>
<strong>What do people who are active on social media in any given country/region (or globally) feel or think about any topic of interest?</strong>
</p><p>
Some of our clients have raised concerns about privacy. We assure you that all the information analysed on Crimson Hexagon by the Citizen Research Centre is information that has been placed in the public domain. All twitter posts are intended for public consumption, and only open posts from other social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, comments, forums and blogs) are available for analysis.
</p><p>
We are reliably informed by Crimson Hexagon themselves that we are the only organisation in the world currently using Crimson Hexagon in this way.
